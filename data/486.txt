Kid Wond3r, you made this beat? Damn
Uh, uh (DY Krazy)
I ain't been this high off perkys in a long time, hmm

I ain't been this high off perkys in a long time
I took two 30s and a half of a third one
I feel like I could see everything with my third eye
Feel like I'm floating, see the world from a birds eye view
These drugs remind me of a girl I knew
A little sweet, a little sour and it vibes with the mood
Ain't no competition, baby, but I'm higher than you
Pray to God I never come down, down, down
Fuck waiting, yeah, I need it right now, now, now
Demons want me, chopper on me, blow 'em down, down, down
New Givenchy with the Rollie flooded, wow, wow, wow
I need some lean, someone pour the muddy, pour the muddy

Your bitch study all my moves just like social studies
I left my kids on her friend, that's her nutty buddy
I remember I was broke, they was runnin' from me
Now everybody in my face tryna be buddy-buddy
Bitch, I'm not your hubby, uh, I don't even want you to touch me
Fifty K on this outfit, floss, I do that shit in public
Nigga I ain't with the fussin', or the fighting at all
I keep the ratchet on me, uh, bullet hole in his head
And now they wanna call the feds, now I'm getting out the jail, yeah (Uh)
Back to the cash flow, three nines 'til the world blow
