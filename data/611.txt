Woah
Sippin' on codeine
Ya dig

She thinkin' that she know me
Prolly get her wetter than your chlorine
Used to take percs with the morphine
Fuck Xanax, I need more beans
I was on the scene with a new tool
Glock with a beam, Freddy Kruger in your dreams
Young nigga, yeah, I'm really youthful
Get on your knees bitch, useful
I'd never love you, I lose you
I'd never love you, I used you
I'ma beat it up, I abuse you
Then we gonna fall off like a loose tooth
Got her on the molly like Hannah Montana
Boolin' out in Cali like a red bandana
Handy Manny with that tool but I'm a loose screw
Make a wave for the drill, that's the new school
Ya dig
