I'm a rockstar in his prime
If I take too many percs then I won't die
That don't make no sense, do it? Haha
If I take too many percs then I won't die
If I drink too much of this syrup then I won't fly

I'm a rockstar in his prime
Rockstar in his prime
Rockstar in his prime
Rockstar in his prime
Rockstar in his prime

If I take too many percs then I won't die
If I drink too much of this syrup then I'm gon' fly
I can't deal with this hurt on my own
I cannot deal with this hurt in my downtime
If I take too many percs then I won't die
If I drink too much of this syrup then I'm gon' fly
I can't deal with this hurt on my own
I can't deal with this hurt

Everything's just fine
Minus the fact I'm losing my mind
Timeless in fact, I know it's my time
Prime time, limelights

Tears on the Saint Laurent
Feel like punching a wall but I don't wanna break the watch
It was just a year ago, I was tellin' people watch
Thanking God, it was a part of the plot
It feel like part of me alive and part of me not
I'm tracing my steps, tryna see where this insanity started
I'm too high to talk right now, I'm sorry, beg my pardon
This not a trend, it's how I'ma deal with my demons regardless
Oh yeah, Devil pulling up  a chair, he sittin' right over there
Tellin' me I should be scared, God in my fuckin' ear
Told me it's nothing to fear
I forgot to mention that the Devil tryna be my friend
Do you hear how confusing this is?
I was at the lowest of points, feelin' like callin' it quits
Ain't nobody understand, "You should be happy, nigga, you're rich," that's what everybody says
Anxiety is a ugly bitch, too ugly to comprehend
So I get high and fuck that bitch
Prayin' for the upper hand, I hope that He hear my prayers
Devil really want my soul, he gon' keep it in his lair
Me, I'm just gon’ keep a pole, paranoia in the air
Everybody gettin' killed, I won't be a part of it

If I take too many percs then I won't die
If I drink too much of this syrup then I'm gon' fly
I can't deal with this hurt on my own
I cannot deal with this hurt in my downtime
If I take too many percs then I won't die
If I drink too much of this syrup then I'm gon' fly
I can't deal with this hurt on my own
I can't deal with this hurt
