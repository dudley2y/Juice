Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps
If they play with you, we gon' spray and leave
Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps
Baby, if they play with you, we finna spray and leave
Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps, yeah
If they play with you, we finna spray then leave
Don't you run away from me, don't you run away from me
Don't you run away from me, don't you run away, run away from me

Don't you run away from me
I told you baby that you're all I need, uh-huh
Ex bitch tryna act like me
She tryna run away with the drip, I see
Two tone skeleton on my wrist, icy
Make her want some ice cream
My eyes low from smokin' doja, damn I need some Visine
Tryna keep my composure but all these people try me
I'm with No Limit, they soldiers, they'll stick you like an IV
I can tell you really like me
I enjoy your vibe and appreciate the company
Look up at the sky, lovely
See the same thing when I look at that look in your eyes
Broke the internet when I kicked that bitch to the side
Goes to show ya, you can't disrespect my love and hope to slide
Niggas think it's sweet 'cause the love songs, right?
That's cool, 'cause they won't be expectin' me to slide

Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps
If they play with you, we gon' spray and leave
Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps
Baby, if they play with you, we finna spray and leave
Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps, yeah
If they play with you, we finna spray then leave
Don't you run away from me, don't you run away from me
Don't you run away from me, don't you run away, run away from me

Don't you run away
Don't you run away from me
They do what they can try to take you away from me
If you try to leave my hearts gon' bleed
It's gon' break in every piece cause you're my inner-peace
My soul gon' seize, I'm on these oxys
When I get off these I'm like a zombie
Hold on to me
Yeah, I'm gon' squeeze
You're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need
I need you for life
Slide, slide, slide
They know I'm from the streets
Ride, ride, ride
Foreign cars I don't lease
Mine, mine, mine
I need you by my side
If you ain't there right now I feel like I might die

Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps
If they play with you, we gon' spray and leave
Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps
Baby, if they play with you, we finna spray and leave
Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps, yeah
If they play with you, we finna spray then leave
Don't you run away from me, don't you run away from me
Don't you run away from me, don't you run away, run away from me
