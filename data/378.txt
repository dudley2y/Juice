Bullets hard to digest, yes
Got my hand on her breasts
You need to get somethin' off your chest, yes
I'm in the gym, Bowflex
Where I come from, the projects
Vector with the big tits
My family I will protect

Mr. Miyagi, I chop it, I bag it, I sell it
The studio, just like a trap house
They Master Splinter, they rattin', they snitchin', they tellin'
There's too many fakes on the real now
Tellin' everybody that they got it on 'em right now
Versace long sleeve cover up the light house
I ride around like I live in the White House
I remember, I was collecting quarters for White Owls

Came a long way alone
Best part about it, I did it on my own
I'ma go to London just to get some scones
After that, let's roam in Rome
Uh, buzzin' off the percs
Talkin' to God, drinkin' that syrup
Feel like I could fly
And just like that, we gone
Out of there, like Barry Bonds
Uh, D&G on, D&G on, D&G on, yeah
Like a picture on the wall, Gucci my draws
Double G on my groin', yeah
D&G on, D&G on, D&G on, yeah
Fuck it, I'ma flaunt, I'm gon' do what I want, yeah
Yeah, sippin' that purple like Prince, yeah
I put all white on the whips, yeah
Look like the Pope in this bitch, yeah
Roxy powder on my lip
Look like we doin' dope in this bitch, yeah
Got the throat from the bitch then it's over with
Bitch, I stay fresh like a pack of deodorant

Hundred round, Kel-Tec
Bullets hard to digest, yes
Got my hand on her breasts
You need to get somethin' off your chest, yes
I'm in the gym, Bowflex
Where I come from, the projects
Vector with the big tits
My family I will protect

Mr. Miyagi, I chop it, I bag it, I sell it
The studio, just like a trap house
They Master Splinter, they rattin', they snitchin', they tellin'
There's too many fakes on the real now
Tellin' everybody that they got it on em right now
Versace long sleeve cover up the light house
I ride around like I live in the White House
I remember, I was collecting quarters for White Owls

Uh, Mortal Kombat with the aim, fatality shot (Uh-huh)
I know it's a lot of fuck niggas tryna come for my spot (Uh-huh)
I know it's a lot of fuck niggas that want what I got
But you can't get it, I'm in the mix
Pick up a gun, pick up a fist, bitch
Talkin' that shit, gun wit a dick
Hit a fuck nigga in his shit, uh
Me not havin' money, don't make any sense
If I go broke, I'ma hit a lick, uh
Acupuncture with this thumper
It's been through a lot of stick ups
I've been through a lot of hiccups
Why these fuck niggas on my dick, bruh?
Um, I don't know why but
It's probably 'cause I'm fly, over average guy
I'm up in the sky, huh
Everyday I get so high, problems to the side
Demons I'ma fight them
Diamonds from a left right combo, Tyson
Ride through life with no license, ayy
