Enviyon on the mix
Yuh, oh
Oh
 then I move
I'm just getting money on the low
 then I move

Times keep on changing
And I see different faces
I've been balling
In the matrix
I've been balling
In the matrix

Go through different phases
All those good times are my favorite
With my lady
That's my everything
She drives me crazy
Like where's that wedding ring

Going through the wringer
Through the wringer
Tryna hold my demeanor
My demeanor
I can see the end
In the phrases
Scared me a minute
I still feel like the center of attention

Times keep on changing
And I see different faces
I've been balling
In the matrix
I've been balling
In the matrix

I go through these mood swings
Got a new girl
That's my new thing
But her heart breaks
It's the same old thing
I'm only one guy
I can't give you everything
So you left with nothing, left with nothing
We ain't making love, I'm making money ()
I'm running up a check I'ma keep on running (In the matrix)
I'm balling in the matrix
I'm balling in the matrix

Times keep on changing
And I see different faces
I've been balling
In the matrix
I've been balling
In the matrix

I'm changing (I)
Faces
I've been balling
In the matrix
I've been balling
In the matrix
