Jet lag shit
Represent Chicago (yeah uh)
Sometimes I feel like I'm the worst
This talent is a gift and a fuckin' curse
This choppa to take you out the fuckin' Earth
Specially if you walkin' on my fuckin' turf
I feel like Ferg how a nigga put in work
R. Kelly with the nina Ima make it flirt
Choppa like a candy make the shit starburst
Look up in the sky, do the stars work?
I'm thinkin that I need Percs
My mom said thats a damn shame and I need work
She say "fuck that shit I need church"
I said "fuck that shit the church need work"
And thats real
I'm happy so its time to take some mad pills
I'm happy so its time to take some sad pills
Fuck a bitch and put her voice up on the adlibs
Ima probably do that
.40 on my hip yeah Ima prolly' shoot that
Bad bitch in my DMs Ima prolly' do that
Hit the gang up and let them run through that
This is off the top like waves in the do-rag
I'll leave your eye blue black
That's just how we do that
That's just how we
Spazin' on they ass do that shit all day
Rock Gucci and Louis but I dont fuck with Balmains
Out the park like a mu'fuckin' baseball game
I'm Barak Obama with it I need all change
Shoot him in his face a couple times like a gun range
Call of Duty with the uzi, this is not a gun game
I run this shit like bolt nigga, no Usain
I do thangs nigga, yeah I do thangs
Off the dome when I spit shit
This is not a writtin'
And these other niggas they be forgettin
That I'm the best to ever fuckin do this
These other niggas lookin' stupid
Betrayin they brothers like who the fuck is you? Judas?
Who the fuck put you to it?
Choppa on my hip, I load it and put it through you
Catch me listenin' to Green Day havin' a blue day
With a bad bitch sippin' on D'USSÃ‰
She'll go both ways, anything for foreplay
That's what I say
Thats what I say, Im so high of the Percs
They lookin' at me sideways
Im goin' 190, the wrong way on the highway
Tryna get my life straight
Catch me drunk drivin in the suburban
With a nigga, the bomb strapped on his chest and a turban
I deserve it, Im ballin hard like I'm Julius Erman
I meant Julius Erving
I keep sippin' the bourbon mix it with the syrup turn to a serpent
One things for sure, two things for certain they blow like Kurtis
My flow close curtains
Your flow ain't workin'
So nigga keep on searchin'
Im sure one day you'll find that person
Everybody talking Lucid Dreams
But most these niggas don't even know Lucid mean
Most of these bitches be really fuckin' losin' me
Eeny meeny miny moe, these hoes get to choosin me
I remember when I ain't have shit
They was treatin' me like i ain't have shit
They was treatin me like I was lower class
They was treatin me like I was a savage
Now they in my DMs tryna say
"Juice you can have it, come over grab it"
I dont wanna have it
I let my bro cut it like he fuckin' stabbed it
Taboe with the Glizzy how I'm jabbin'
How I'm jabbin'
Man spendin' money is a bad habit
But I ball out with this shit, I'm a Maverick
Make em disappear like magic
Call a plane then I execute like Madden
Off a flat in a bad bitch house
Tryna' get it crackin' from the back end (yeah hm)
Yeah
Uh uh uh uh yeah
Uh uh uh uh yeah
Fresh off the jet
Freestyle and shit
Eminem beats, 8mile and shit
Where I came from the great wild and shit
Where you would get shot if you crack smiles and shit
All my niggas goin' too hard and shit
I'll pull your bitch like a card and shit
Heard she for sale I'm bargainin'
At the door, I'm barging in
Yellow boned like Marge again
I spread her out like margarine
I just marchin' in
Feelin' like a spartan kid
