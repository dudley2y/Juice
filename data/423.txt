Lyrics from Snippet

Hahahaha, Nick you're stupid

My heart's racing even on vacation
But I'm trying to focus on you, my baby
I know my past heartbreaks and chances, I'll take them
It's not hard to tell that you drive me crazy
My heart's racing even on vacation
But I'm trying to focus on you, my baby
I know my past heartbreaks and chances, I'll take them
It's not hard to tell that you drive me crazy

You know my flaws
You know all my fuck ups and past mistakes
Our love is law
The only law I would never break
I'll fight for us
Through bloody nights and through bloody days
You hate it when my dragon gets out the cage
All my demons unchain
But you still don't run away

I thought I'd make this song for you
To sing along, inspire
I would kill anything, anyone, everyone for you
I would slay 'em all down

My heart's racing even on vacation
But I'm trying to focus on you, my baby
I know my past heartbreaks and chances, I'll take them
It's not hard to tell that you drive me crazy
My heart's racing even on vacation
But I'm trying to focus on you, my baby
I know my past heartbreaks and chances, I'll take them
It's not hard to tell that you drive me crazy
