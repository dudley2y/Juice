Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning
And I (And I), and I (And I), mhm (Mhm), mhm
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Excuse my language that's a hang up on how shitty I been feeling
And I (And I) told (Told), uh
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute
And I, and I, and I, and I, survived the night
Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Why'd you lie?
Excuse my language that's a hang up on how shitty I been feeling
Realize, realize, realize, this life (This life, this life, this life)
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute

Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can but you can't hide
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can

In her soul, dark and light fight for the control
Nobody knows
In her soul, dark and light fight for the control
Don't anyone know, don't anyone know

Money is happiness, cap
Bitches got faithfulness, cap
And drugs only make it worse, cap
I take a perc, then I take me a nap
Take a sip of the syrup so I could go relax
Bitch, I'm ready for war when the demons attack
Hell yeah, believe that

One to the face, don't fuckin' hesitate
I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down
One to the face, don't fuckin' hesitate
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down (Down, down, down)
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down (Realize)
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down

Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can but you can't hide
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can but you can't hide
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can

Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning
