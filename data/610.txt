Ballin' like prime time
Girl, I'm really trying to get you on my time
(TheBeatAsylum)
Ballin' like prime time
Girl, I'm really trying to get you on my time
(Yeah, I like that)

Ballin' like prime time
Girl, I'm really trying to get you on my time
Girl, I really can't get you off my mind
It's been a while since we last spoke, funny how time flies
I don't really like how time flies, I remember when I was a good guy
Now she think that I'm a bad guy, I was just caught up in the fast life
I remember I was taking my time, felt like I was in the past life

I'm in my prime, bae, ain't taking my time, no, I ain't taking my time
All in my mind, bae, all in my mind, you're still all in my mind
I've been out of my mind, I've been out of my mind
Feeling like I'm running out of time
Feeling like I'm living a lie
I've been out of my mind, bae

Drugs getting harder to find
Maybe you its a sign of the times, bae
I've been out of my mind

Ballin' like prime time
Girl, I'm really trying to get you on my time
Girl, I really can't get you off my mind
It's been a while since we last spoke, funny how time flies
I don't really like how time flies, I remember when I was a good guy
Now she think that I'm a bad guy, I was just caught up in the fast life
I remember I was taking my time, felt like I was in the past life

(Drink more water, styrofoam with the soda)
Just to get their attention and shit, you know what what I'm saying?
Drink more water, styrofoam with the soda
Drink more water, styrofoam with the soda
No more water, styrofoam with the soda
No more water, styrofoam with the soda

(Soda)
Drink more water, styrofoam with the soda
Drink more water, styrofoam with the soda
No more water, styrofoam with the soda
No more water, styrofoam with the soda

God damn, I been sellin' hard, I been doing wrong
God damn, I been sellin' hard, I been doing wrong, tryna right my wrongs
Drink more water, I need to drink more water
She mad at me because I left her out, we goin' harder
She broke my heart hard, had to break her heart harder
She played the game wrong, so I played the game smarter
Drink more water, I don't really got no water
I started from the bottom, yeah, I had some dirty water
I turned nothin' into somethin', styrofoam with the soda
Drink more water, styrofoam with the soda
