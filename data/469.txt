I kill you
Ayy
I got my niggas David and Brandon in the booth with me, haha, yeah
(Forever in my mind, only you)
And me and Pedro finna make this hit, haha, yeah
(The pieces in my life, go away with you)
(Forever in my mind)

Here we go, call you Mrs. Miracle
Beautiful, I say this all the time, but girl, you beautiful
Gorgeous, and I hope you know that I'ma make this Forbes list
And I hope you know that you gon' be my number one supporter (Forever in my—)
Me and you finesse together
I see you makin' money and I see you spendin' fifties, yeah, I see you spendin' hundreds
You make it rain on these hoes, I'ma bring the thunder
I'm finna ball on these hoes like I'm on the Thunders
Ain't no fuss around, ain't tryna fuck around
Was poppin' Xanax to forget about my ex
I would take 'em down with Actavis to get up out that stress
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout them diamonds I'ma put around your neck, that's real
I was too busy countin' the upsets
Now I'm lookin' in the future, prepare for what's next
I seen an angel in the sky and I'm screamin' "Oh, what's that?"
You that angel in the sky and you—

Forever in my mind (Only you)
Shit, only you, ooh (The pieces in my life, go away with you)
Go away with you, oh-oh (Forever in my mind, only you)
You got me singin' to this shit, for real (Forever in my mind, only you)
Shit, only you (The pieces in my life, go away with you)
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, look
(Forever in my—)

I think I fell in love again, I call this dirty trippin'
And my last relationship was fake, I think it's best forgettin'
And my next relationship was great, lookin' forward to it
And I'm never goin' back to her, I need some forward movement
I see you from a mile away 'cause I can notice beauty
And this shit is so unreal to me, you put me in a movie
And Cupid put that arrow down and hit me with that uzi
And I said this shit a movie, right, hit me with that Clooney
Listen closely, I'ma tell you how you got me
You amazin' on your own, you can do this shit without me
I see you makin' money and I love the way you count it
Shit, I'm countin' money with you, we should hire some accountants, woah-woah
Yeah, I love the way this feel, bae
Just be one hundred, dress it up and make it real, baby
It's funny how we both real and we real crazy
And it's crazier how you—

Forever in my mind (Only you), ayy, haha
(The pieces in my life, go away with you)
Go away with you, oh, ayy (Forever in my mind, only you)
Only you, oh, haha (The pieces in my life, go away with you)
I got one more for her ass, haha, look, ayy, ayy, ayy, look
(Forever—)

I done had my heart broken from the last forever
Which proves forever don't even really last forever
But this a different girl, I know we finna last together
And I know it's not my first, but I hope you my last together (Forever—)
I have to move around and not live in the past forever
And you beautiful and cute, man, we be gettin' cash together
I promise I be by your side where ever and whenever
And I could put that on my life that I would do whatever
And I just gotta say one thing
Gorgeous, oh, gorgeous and so good at hustling
Lookin' so lovely, your attitude sexy
Your hair be on fleek and your bank account flexin'
I could go on and on about you but the song is almost over
Couldn't make this song without you, 'cause I wrote this one about you
Fall in love, I think I'm 'bout to, fall in love, I think I'm 'bout to 'cause you—

Forever on my mind (Forever in my mind, only you), ayy
(The pieces in my life, go away with you)
I just killed this beat for you, shit, hahaha
(Forever in my mind, only you)
(The pieces in my life, go away with you)
(Forever)
