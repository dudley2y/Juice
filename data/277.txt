I ain't have love in a minute (Have love in a minute)

Takeoff (Oh, oh, oh)
When I'm in my feelings (Oh, oh, oh)
I bought me some codeine, just so I can't feel it (Drank, lean)
No doc or nurse, a pharmacy, needed the way I'm prescriptin' (Sippin', oh, oh, oh)
Pray I don't get cursed, rebukin' the demons with the Holy Spirit (God)
And I was makin' it work, before I had fame, I had to go get it (Did it)
I'm down to run up some M&M's, my niggas you wit' it (M&M's, oh, oh, oh)
The cash, the racks, the bags, if you sendin' M's, my nigga you get it (Cheese)
You tryna fuck with the rocket, what's in your pocket better come wit' it (Come wit' it)
Run around, tellin' somebody, behind me, first to be murdered had did it (Brr, oh, oh, oh)
Don't know what you heard but they lyin'
If I ain't the greatest, then who is you kiddin'? (Who?)
I go and put on a piece of my jewelry, my definition of chillin' (Ice, oh, oh, oh)
Ain't been in love in a minute so baby, I'm sorry if I lose the feeling (Sorry)
They want us to stop taking drugs but ain't nobody stoppin' the killing (Why?)

Lately, I've been drownin' in my feelings
She don't give me problems when she swallowin' my children
Talk behind my back, then you go try and play the victim
Like you couldn't talk to me all the times we was chillin'
I don't want to feel this pain, guess some people never change
I got my head in the rain, double cups and Mary Jane
We don't look at life the same, deep depression in my brain
I would give my life for you, just so you see better days
I wake up sad, I can't wait to go to bed
I got demons in my head, tryna leave me left for dead
I battle with myself about the things I never said
She told me that she love me and I left her ass on read

She be tryna ball hard in the scrimmage
Then I tell you I don't care about practice
Run a full court press on a mattress
In the strip club, throwin' dubs, she hit back flips

I ain't have love in a minute (Have love in a minute)
I've been on drugs for a minute (I've been on drugs for a minute)
I ain't hit my plug in a minute (Ain't hit my plug, yeah)
Lately, I've been drownin' in my feelings (Lately, I've been drownin' in my feelings)

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
