Lyrics Based Off Snippet

Bitch yeah, let me put my dick on your face
Oh yeah, now you gotta fuck my gang
.40 in my hands, time to finger fuck you, bae
Lamborghini in LA, let's have a race, race, race
I'm in a ghost, peek a boo, I'm in a Wraith, Wraith, Wraith
 in my hands, , aye, aye
Hunnid wrist
They ain't rich
Hunnid wrist
I'm in the studio, don't need to pay
Bad little bitch in the back of the Benz
, got me on ten
I remember Klonopins
Fuck them tens
Young rich nigga fuck up them bands
I'ma fuck you but I want the top from your friend
Yeah, bring her right in
Say you wanna fight, squeak, hit em with that left right
Corey got the torch, don't come right, you get left right
Gmoney countin' bands, tellin' me I need to get my head right
I don't know, put the money over hoes
Bitches...
