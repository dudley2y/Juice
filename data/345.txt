Love me, leave me
You thought you were getting out that easy
Love me, leave me
You thought you were getting out that easy
No, no, no-no
No, no, no-no
No, no, no-no
You thought you were getting out that easy

I don't even wanna talk if I can't hear your voice
I don't even wanna walk if you ain't by my side
Bought Balenciagas, thinkin' of you
Almost bought a pair in your size, huh
I see the truth in your lies, huh
I see the proof in your eyes
If loving you is wrong then I'm such a fool
I'ma be dumb 'til I die

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so damn scared
She fucks me on the electric chair
Death penalties, death melodies, woah
Not heavenly, not heavenly, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so damn scared
She fucks me on the electric chair
Death penalty's, death melodies
Not heavenly, not heavenly, oh

Love me, leave me
You thought you were getting out that easy
Love me, leave me
You thought you were getting out that easy
No, no, no-no
No, no, no-no
No, no, no-no
You thought you were getting out that easy

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so damn scared
She fucks me on the electric chair
Death penalties, death melodies, woah
Not heavenly, not heavenly, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so damn scared
She fucks me on the electric chair
Death penalty's, death melodies, woah
Not heavenly, not heavenly, oh

Love me, leave me
You thought you were getting out that easy
Love me, leave me
You thought you were getting out that easy
No, no, no-no
No, no, no-no
No, no, no-no
You thought you were getting out that easy
