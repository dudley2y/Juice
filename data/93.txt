Lyrics from Snippets

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I sometimes get lost in my head
I'm so in love with that girl
I got the juice in this world
She don't believe in loyalty, but want diamonds and pearls
Fuck that, I had to man up
Tried to boost my confidence and froze my hand up
I'm still hot, turn that fan on
This shit had me depressed, I almost died of sadness
She said that she love me but she sucked that boy off
You got somethin' to say, go 'head and point, you speak up
Tryna break me down because they can't defeat us
I'ma break her down like that girl a nina
Should've listened to my boy, he said, "Don't keep her"
Nowadays I love you so much, I can't leave you

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
