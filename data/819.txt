I run to the , yeah
They say they with me but I get on the road, yeah
But no, this is not the city I know
They wanna take me on the road, yeah
Me not wanna go there

Counting the racks with me and my bros, yeah
People stealing my phone, yeah
People stealing my phone, yeah
Right around there on the road, yeah
Right around there on the road, yeah
Right around thеre on the road, yeah

Let it out, let it out, let it out

But no, this is not the city I know
They wanna take me on the road, yeah
Me not wanna go there

Counting the racks with me and my bros, yeah
People stealing my phone, yeah
