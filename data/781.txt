Lyrics From Snippet

CashMoneyAP
Always pourin' up the act and I don't know how to act
Run up on me, you get clapped
I don't know how to act
Yeah, oh

Pull up with my next but I'm fucking on my ex
And I'm best dressed with Givanci on my chest
Pull up got a Tec, I'ma put it to your neck
 on your neck, got your bitch she giving neck
Pull up to the trap with my niggas in the back
And I got the strap, niggas don't know how to act
I'ma take his bitch, give her back, that's a fact
I'ma take his bitch but she don't know how to act so I don't know how to act

Hop up in that steamer and I don't know how to act
I just got a beamer and I don't know how to act
Run up on me, that's ok you know I got my mag
You be talking dumb until I pull up with a mag
 jeans sag
Balmain boy, run up on me got a bag
Rich nigga shit
Rich nigga bitch
Niggas talking dumb, I get you off quick
But he got a 40
That's a different story
You listen to me when I'm talking, that shit mandatory
And all these niggas is my sons, I think I need Maury
Run up that's ok, get a little gory
Pull up in that drop-top and my next
I'm too busy flexing on my ex to care about my next
I just found out 'bout my ex

Pull up with my next but I'm fucking on my ex
And I'm best dressed with Givanci on my chest
Pull up got a Tec, I'ma put it to your neck
 on your neck, got your bitch she giving neck
Pull up to the trap with my niggas in the back
And I got the strap, niggas don't know how to act
I'ma take his bitch, give her back, that's a fact
I'ma take his bitch but she don't know how to act so I don't know how to act

Yeah I'm back, that's a fact
Got your mom doing crack
I was whipping in the trap so I don't know how to act
Balmain on my jeans with the RAF Simmons matched
And I got my goyard on my waist, it's a trap
 in designer, coolin' in the trap
