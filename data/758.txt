I need champagne over ice
Dark liquor over light
Drink on me, wanna die
Feel my hands in her thighs
I been counting dirty money all my life
Say she wanna stay the night
I know she got her past, but I always gotta bang
So I guess she gets to pass tonight
Haven't had real love all my life
I need champagne over ice
Dark liquor over light
Bottles when she on my mind
Kick it in the overdrive
I've been getting fucked up all my life

I've been getting fucked up all my life
All day all the way to the night time
With the right timе
Do me wrong 'til the wrong feel right
I guess bad lovе's still love at the end of the day, right?
Maybe I should take my time
I always have a tendency to rush things, hoping they will be fine
I been going out of my mind
I only come out in the night time
I don't deal with sunshine
I'm not your type
But you know I'm on the rise
So you wanna compromise
Bound to leave me traumatized
I've been getting love drunk all my life

I need champagne over ice
Dark liquor over light
Bottles when she on my mind
Kick it in the overdrive
I've been getting fucked up all my life
Say she wanna spend the night
I know she got her past
I know we'd never last
She gotta go home tonight
Won't let another dumb bitch ruin my life

Are you dumb, bitch? Are you dumb? Bitch, are you drunk?
I'm in love with all the bullshit that you on
I've been stressin' baby girl, you been on my mind
Reminiscin' I still think about all the time
You were all but nobody
Then you switched up, now you probably like a great white
Getting mixed up with the pills and the nightlife
Got me fucked up, can't sleep, need to not lie
Diamond, your price
I just want a love that'll last me a lifetime
Mama hate the plug for the drugs in the meantime
Cross my heart, really over, don't (?)

I need champagne over ice
Dark liquor over light
Bottles when she on my mind
Kick it in the overdrive
I've been getting fucked up all my life
Say she wanna spend the night
I know she got her past
I know we'd never last
She gotta go home tonight
Won't let another dumb bitch ruin my life
