Lyrics from Snippet

Yea a secret
If I give you my heart then you can keep it
See your love is a drug and I been Feinen'
I'm a addict, I'm a addict, girl I need it
Uh , keep it
If I give you my heart, you better keep it
Girl, keep it
If I give you my heart, you better keep it

Butterflies when your on my mind, I can't breathe well
In the night, you ain't by my side, I can't sleep well
 is gettin' 
 FaceTime, 

 help me 
My anxiety has me wired, but girl you help me sit still
You the only 
Runnin' to these hearts , you know how this shit feel
 die for me, niggas that'll die for me
Girl I know you'll ride for me, you my homicide for me
Shoot at any bitch
 meet me at the cliff, aye,  bay
Let's go back to my place, 
 in the doorway,  the hallway
 Over bitches 
I'ma let you go 'cause , because you can have my heart, ayy

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away
There was a love so divine
The same love that ended up in my face

Yea a secret
If I give you my heart then you can keep it
See your love is a drug and I been Feinen'
I'm a addict, I'm a addict, girl I need it
Uh , keep it
If I give you my heart, you better keep it
Girl, keep it
If I give you my heart, you better keep it

Butterflies when your on my mind, I can't breathe well
In the night, you ain't by my side, I can't sleep well
 is gettin' 
 FaceTime, 
Yea a secret
If I give you my heart then you can keep it
See your love is a drug and I been Feinen'
I'm a addict, I'm a addict, girl I need it
Uh , keep it
If I give you my heart, you better keep it
Girl, keep it
If I give you my heart, you better keep it

Butterflies when your on my mind, I can't breathe well
In the night, you ain't by my side, I can't sleep well
 is gettin' 
 FaceTime, 

 help me 
My anxiety has me wired, but girl you help me sit still
You the only 
Runnin' to these hearts , you know how this shit feel
 die for me, niggas that'll die for me
Girl I know you'll ride for me, you my homicide for me
Shoot at any bitch
 meet me at the cliff, aye,  bay
Let's go back to my place,
