We're laying in bed
You see that
I lock eyes, our eyes lock

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
We're down, we're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

I'm off the percs, you don't condone it
You say it makes me act atrocious
But I can't stand life when I'm sober, take my heart, I'll hand it over
6 months in it gets colder, I don't want us to be over
Let's make love until we die, and let's fuck til we slumpt over
Be my first date, I know you hate to see me bleed
I don't deserve your love, I tend to fuck up everything
It feels like I'm not enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
This a conversation, not a love song

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
We're down, we're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

I wanna know, is it gonna be forever or temporary?
If you leave it'll hurt, keep the tissue ready
Got the drugs on the table, Iâ€™m ready
Put Rick on your slippers, no Cinderella
Remember when you went to the fortune teller
She told you we need each other
Ha, what if she's trippin'? I'm just kidding
Back to the main focus, I think that you're gorgeous
You love the way that I stroke it, signing my name on your neck
You used to make potions, play around with witchcraft
I wonder if you put that in my lean and I drank that

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
We're down, we're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

We met in a Twilight Zone
I fall apart, but you keep me whole
We met on the West Coast
But I still see Miami in your soul

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
We're down, we're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh
