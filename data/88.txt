808 Mafia
Haha, it's lit, preach it, haha
Gezin
I fuck the blunt up, haha
Yeah, I’m on marijuana (Marijuana)
My lean plug say he'll be here in a second (Pull up)
I'm getting high, I’m feelin' restless (I'm sad)
Feel like I'm finna die (R.I.P.)

Fuck the blunt up then fuck your momma (Uh-huh)
My VVS cold like an arctic tundra
.40 on me, woah, you don't want no problems
And you best proceed with some caution, yeah
This song for the girl with the blonde hair
Suck me up good, give me Becky, like, yeah
She ride it, like, yeah, in a Versace chair
Her boyfriend heated like a grill, no hibachi, yeah

I'm high as hell
Mind everywhere, still mind over matter
Pockets getting fatter, elevate like a ladder
.30 and that .40 make you percolate like a dancer
I'm colder than the North Pole, Blitzen and Prancer
She say she from the strip pole, she a dirty dancer
Her ex-nigga too low, she don't got no standards
He ain’t right, me? I live a better life
Ran it up like Jerry Rice, I don’t gotta say it twice
This is real life, your nigga is Fisher-Price
I can read minds, you was thinkin' ’bout how I'm that nigga, right?

Fuck the blunt up then fuck your momma (Uh-huh)
My VVS cold like an arctic tundra
.40 on me, woah, you don't want no problems
And you best proceed with some caution, yeah
This song's for the girl with the blonde hair
Suck me up good, give me Becky, like, yeah
She ride it, like, yeah, in a Versace chair
Her boyfriend heated like a grill, no hibachi, yeah

Time, time will tell, I’m sad as hell
Being broke made me sadder
Ran all them bands up, uh, still frownin'
When my world upside down, I'm smilin'
Turn my frown upside down? I doubt it
Like yeah, these are my tears
Sing away my fears, Buzz Lightyears away from here, ayy
Catch me somewhere fuckin' a blunt up
And fuckin' on your momma

Fuck the blunt up then fuck your momma (Uh-huh)
My VVS cold like an arctic tundra
.40 on me, woah, you don't want no problems
And you best proceed with some caution, yeah
This song's for the girl with the blonde hair
Suck me up good, give me Becky, like, yeah
She ride it, like, yeah, in a Versace chair
Her boyfriend heated like a grill, no hibachi, yeah
