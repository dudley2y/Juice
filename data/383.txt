It's been a while since I last saw you
I was cruisin' in the coupe
I was with my crew
It's been a while since I last loved you
So I don't know what to do
I'm just in the studio
Had to break my heart in two, now there's one half of me, one half of you
But the last time I saw you, I was ridin' in the coupe
Coolin' with my crew, coolin' with my crew

No, no, no, no
I was off the molly, I'm on go mode
Say she wanna make a movie, grab the GoPro
Then she broke my heart, so that's a no-no
Life's a picture, I'm just posin' for the photo
I got Givenchy and Louis on the logo
Whoa, run up on me that's a no go
In the cut with a Gucci bag, and a four poured

It's been a while since I last saw you
I was cruisin' in the coupe
I was with my crew
It's been a while since I last loved you
So I don't know what to do
I'm just in the studio
Had to break my heart in two, now there's one half of me, one half of you
But the last time I saw you, I was ridin' in the coupe
Coolin' with my crew, coolin' with my crew

If looks could kill, she's a murderer
The boys in the band all heard of her
She a rock star fan, so she drop when I say
When we off the drugs, ain't no stoppin' us, ayy
Baby I do what I want, I don't do what you say
In the party with the pills, mix it with the D'usse
I'ma ball til' I'm bald, coach I need a tupee
Kick, push, love like she fuck with Lupe

It's been awhile since I last saw you
I was cruisin' in the coupe
I was with my crew
It's been awhile since I last loved you
So I don't know what to do
I'm just in the studio
Had to break my heart in two, now there's one half of me, one half of you
But the last time I saw you, I was ridin' in the coupe
Coolin' with my crew, coolin' with my crew
