Yeah, oh, oh, I'ma go all in
I'ma fuck her 'til the sun comes out
I see cocaine on her gums
I see the lies, they're on her tongue
Oh, oh, I'ma go all in
I'ma fuck her 'til the sun comes out
I see cocaine on her gums
I see lies all on her tongue

Hungover, put the pills in the OJ, yeah
I don't sip liquor, it's the Codeine, yeah
Kill my pain with the Morphine
I'm numb, ayy, I'm numb, ayy
No pain, take the struggles away
She asked me how many did I take

I see cocaine on her gums
I see the lies, they're on her tongue
Oh, oh, I'ma go all in
I'ma fuck her 'til the sun comes out
I see cocaine on her gums
I see lies all on her tongue


I'ma go all in
I'ma fuck her 'til the sun comes out
I see cocaine on her gums
I see the lies, they're on her tongue
Oh, oh, I'ma go all in
I'ma fuck her 'til the sun comes out
I see cocaine on her gums
I see lies all on her tongue
