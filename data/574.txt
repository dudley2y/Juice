Lyrics from Snippet

...What are we?
She asked, “What are we?“ (What are we?)
What are we? (What are we?)
Let’s take this conversation up in the morning again

It's the morning again
Turn off the news, it's fucked up
Global warming again
It's 5PM, let’s get fucked up, 'til the morning again
She's so purdy, I'll fuck her 'til the morning again
Now it's the morning again
It's the morning again
Turn off the news, it's fucked up
Global warming again
It's 5PM, let’s get fucked up, 'til the morning again
She's so purdy, I fuck her until the morning again
I fuck her 'till the morning (Morning)
I fuck her 'till the morning
Dead presidents, we should be mourning (Morning)

Uh, see last night wasn't like the night before
I can't do that shit no more
I'll get so high off Percocets that I couldn't even get off the floor
Couldn't even feel my feet (Nah)
I was so damn high she was turned off
Still got her clothes off, she ain't need no pills, I ain't Bill Cos'
In the morning again, it's the morning again
Last night throwing em' dead pres' it's morning all again
She asked, “What are we?“ (What are we?)
What are we? (What are we?)
What are we?
We should take this up, maybe in the morning again

It's the morning again
Turn off the news, it's fucked up
Global warming again
It’s 5PM let’s get fucked up 'till the morning again
She's so purdy I fuck her until the morning
 her around in the morning again
It's the morning again
It's the morning again
Turn off the news, it's fucked up
Global warming again
It's 5pm let’s get fucked up till the morning
Before you know it, I guess it'll be the morning
Again, again
It'll be the morning, again....
