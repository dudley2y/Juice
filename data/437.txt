Yeah, uh

Sometimes, really wanna know what you're thinking
Alright, really wanna know what you're thinking
On your mind, really wanna know what you're thinking, babe
I really wanna know what you're, uh
Sometimes, really wanna know what you're thinking
Oh, I really wanna know, wanna know what's on your mind
Yeah, is it the same thing that's on mine, mine, mine?

Somethin' telling me Satan not a hard thinker, yeah
I ain't really take him as a hard thinker, yeah
But I ain't really take him as the devil either
Nowadays his name is pronounced, "Overdose Perky Fever"
Oh, death was in my mental, bae, you're also on my skull
You kick them demons out my head, you tell 'em that they got to go
Treat them like some groupie hoes, silly goofy hoes
Then you proceed to unpack your things and turn my head into your home
You do the same thing with my heart, uh, oh
You put the hell flames out, you make the love scars go away
Now Lotti, you're in my soul
The end of the world wouldn't make you go away
I know that you're here to stay
The devil can't make you go away
He don't know God the one that put you in this place (Haha), ayy

Sometimes, really wanna know what you're thinking
Alright, really wanna know what you're thinking
On your mind, really wanna know what you're thinking, babe
I really wanna know what you're, uh
Sometimes, really wanna know what you're thinking
Oh, I really wanna know, wanna know what's on your mind
Yeah, is it the same thing that's on mine, mine, mine?

Dark thoughts, you're the light tunnel
All, all these dark thoughts
It's all with a soul, it'll haunt you, you
By blood involve you
Endanger all the loved ones around you
That's when he himself surrounds you (All these dark thoughts)
When your demons be themselves and clown you (Thoughts, thoughts, thoughts)
Wasn't your friend to start with (Thoughts)
Now you sittin' there soul-less (Thoughts)
Might as well have pentagrams runnin' on your popist
As a demon I was gorgeous, but I was full of torment
Shit start gettin' annoyin', yeah
I could feel my soul burnin'

Put all that shit away, I locked it up, it's in a dungeon
Cellar in my head but the key is in my stomach
Perkys dropping in me, pray to God that I don't unlock it
Bible in my hand, key to my destruction in my pocket

Sometimes, really wanna know what you're thinking
Alright, really wanna know what you're thinking
On your mind, really wanna know what you're thinking, babe
I really wanna know what you're, uh
Sometimes, really wanna know what you're thinking
Oh, I really wanna know, wanna know what's on your mind
Yeah, is it the same thing that's on mine, mine, mine?

Oh, that's on mine
Oh, on my mind
Oh, it gon' come alive
Oh, that's not
So out of my mind
Pray that I'm comin' down
No, not tonight
So hold on, love
Oh, sippin' that dirty Sprite
Oh, damn near finna die
Oh, said that's why I
Know when you're alone
Oh, yes, I know
Oh, oh, oh
