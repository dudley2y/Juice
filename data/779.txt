I don't wanna lose, I don’t wanna lose you
Turn into a swimming pool
Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool, pool

Now I’m drowning, I am not aware of my surroundings
You used to make me feel perfect, and now I am a whole different person
I don't wanna lose, I don’t wanna lose
Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool
I keep going down misery avenue, I keep driving down misery avenue
Don't know what to do
Love is such a war, I'ma call a truce
Taking all my demons in this fucking booth
I'ma just keep it bool, But I can’t keep my cool
Cause, yeah, I don't wanna lose
You keep me on my P's & Q's, you keep me on my P's & Q's
Life is a race and I’m in last place, everything turned gray
Shit is not straight, Shit is not okay
You're in my way, but you make my day
And I see the love fade, I see the love fade
I always throw shade, and it's coming your way
Cause it’s not okay, yeah it’s not okay, it’s not okay
I'ma deal with it, life is hard to swallow take a pill with it
Looking for a new girl to have now, who gon' hold me down
I said I’m Looking for a new girl to have now, who gon' hold me down
In the studio, hit it twice to go girl feel like coolio
That's yo ex cool, that's my newest ho
Fuck one I need two of those

I don't wanna lose, I don’t wanna lose
Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool
I don't wanna fucking lose, Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool
Turn this Hennessy into a swimming pool

I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna lose
