Bro said he's back in the hood
And he got MACs in the back of his hood
Pillow talking you get snatched in the hood
Fuck around and get dragged to the back of the woods
Killers lurking, murking, searching for danger
You step out your place, get put back where you should
Me and Juice taking plugs out the socket
They trapped in the trap like bear traps in the woods
And that's cool
I'm doing this shit that my momma don't know
The plug hit my line, he got drugs for the low
But I rob all my plugs I just hope it don't show
Juice got the juice but the gun with him too
If you flinch one more time, then he might let it go
Plug meet me up, i just act like its nothing
Juice hop out, he clutching the thing at his throat
 on the floor
We gon run it back, ain't talking bout m's on my nigga, we score
Man I got bars like a xan, like a gate, like a prison
My nigga you already know
Bar after bar, I got bars in narcotics
If you need 'em, just hit me, just don't call my phone
Meet me in person, put niggas in hearses
Them boss is like mad at them, bitches too strong, ayy

New finesse, new finesse
New finesse, new (Ayy)
One finesse, two finesse, we finesse you
New finesse, new finesse
New finesse, new (Ayy)
One finesse, ayy, two finesse, okay

Woah, woah, woah
New finesse, new finesse
New finesse, new
Smokin' dope, never stress, fly like JetBlue
Run up on me, that's okay, what this TEC do?
I just asked your main bitch, "What the neck do?"
I get the money then flip it and get it again
Niggas talk shit, well I'm in
Talkin' that shit, that's okay I run up with that thing
That thing'll get a nigga fan
I might pull up in a Benz, fuck on a couple of fans
Count up a couple of bands
Shoot at a couple of feds
Takin' them shots to the head, woah
Xannin', Xannin', Xannin', baby, I'm Xannin'
Run up on me, I'ma kill you, you standin'
No you not, I got to shootin' and fannin'
I leave a nigga btich so fuckin' stranded
I been ballin' out like I'm from Atlanta
I been goin' crazy, nigga, you know it
You could catch me pourin' all of the Fanta
Got the lean and you know my loud is potent, ayy
New finesse, new finesse, new finesse
Fuckin' your bitch from the back while I count up a sack
Motherfucker, I never stress
Niggas talk shit, that's okay, I got K's
And I put that to you and I let you rest
Any nigga talkin' stupid to me, I'ma come through, hit him with a TEC (This that new finesse)

New finesse, new finesse
New finesse, new (Ayy)
One finesse, two finesse, we finesse you
New finesse, new finesse
New finesse, new (Ayy)
One finesse, ayy, two finesse, okay
