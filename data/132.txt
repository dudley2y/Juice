Honorable Court

Let my insecurities take over
Right now it's kinda hard to stay sober
Last thing I wanna hear is, “It's over”
Love is deadly, it's gon' put me in a coma
If I lose you, then I'm losin' my composure
Got me flippin' in my coffin, turnin' over
All this pain in my chest got my lungs hurt
She gon' stab me in my left side, heart burst

I'm so scared, I'm so-so scared
That I care, and you don't care
Momma always told me not to have any fears
But this shit is deadly, like electric chair
You told me you leavin', death to my ears
This shit ain't Houdini baby, don't disappear
Heart break and harmony, feel it in the air
Tell Cupid stick to his day job, yeah
I passed out in the party and almost died right there
All the drug use startin' to pay off, yeah
I don't work a job, but I lay off, yeah
The devil on my shoulder need to stay off, yeah
