I hope, I
I hope you choke and die, on my name
I hope, I hope you choke and die, oh

You got my name in your mouth, hope you choke and die on it
Talking 'bout my love life, hope you get a reply on it
Well, here, get your response, not gon' be what you want
With my wifey, I'm in love, bitch, you just wasn't the one
The worse, uh, bitch, you were the worst, shit, just like herpes
I remember when you told me you ain't know if you had herpes
Got some nerves, sneak dissin' with words, thinking I wouldn't nerve
I'd throw your business out there and leave it on the curb

You ain't worthy, bitch, you a clown, here's the circus
I've been working, you've been in the grass as a serpent
Lurkin', probably jealous 'cause I've been splurging
On my baby, bought her yellow diamonds and a Birkin
You ain't worthy, bitch, you a clown, here's the circus
I've been working, you've been in the grass as a serpent
Lurkin', probably jealous 'cause I've been splurging
On my baby, bought her yellow diamonds and a Birkin

Leave them in the past, yeah, I won't miss her
I burned all of her paraphernalia
The makeup and the panties, they ain't on my dresser
Fuck all of the days when I used to undress her

Getting really tired, I'm gonna put you in your place
I feel like throwing up and vomiting every time I see your face
What a waste, uh, what a waste of motherfucking space
We in bed, we won't let you ruin our day, no
You can't see us, bitch, you Ray Charles
You can't see us, John Cena
Dirty bitch, need to go to the cleaners
Lotti is my everything, you could never be her
Or beat her, not afraid to hit you with this heat if you mistreat her
'Til the day I die, I'm gon' have Ally fever
Don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with me either
Habitual soul, yeah

You ain't worthy, bitch, you a clown, here's the circus
I've been working, you've been in the grass as a serpent
Lurkin', probably jealous 'cause I've been splurging
On my baby, bought her yellow diamonds and a Birkin
You ain't worthy, bitch, you a clown, here's the circus
I've been working, you've been in the grass as a serpent
Lurkin', probably jealous 'cause I've been splurging
On my baby, bought her yellow diamonds and a Birkin

Leave her in the past, now I won't miss her
I burned all of her paraphernalia
Yeah, the makeup and the panties, they ain't on my dresser
Fuck all of the days when I used to undress her

(Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)
(Oh, oh)
