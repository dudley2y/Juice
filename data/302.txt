Jamz, turn me up

She told me we forever
Fuck forever, I just wanna fuck forever
Off a perky I could probably fuck forever
.40 on my hip, that's for whoever
He say he gon' kill me, I say whatever
Niggas talk too much
Tell 'em shut the fuck up, before we shoot the place up
He wanna fight cool, first let me smoke my blunt
Let me load my gun, pull it out, they run, hey
Rockstar lifestyle, I won't make it
Bad lil' bitch in the hotel naked
She told me that she know that I talk to Satan
He say he tryna kill me, baby keep on prayin'
Left my perks in the room, left the shrooms in there too
I got nothin' to lose, I don't pity the fool
If he keeps on makin' a ruckus, he'll be makin' the news
Call my New York nigga up to come to chop 'em in two, ooh
You sayin' that you didn't do what you do
But my shooters already on you, they gon' do what they do, ooh
Look at your bitch, the way she fuckin' the crew
The way she fuckin' the crew, she think she part of the crew, cool

I turn it up, I got nothin' to lose
Get fucked up when it's nothin' to do, oh
No handouts, don't got nothin' for you, oh
Gun on my waist I got somethin' to prove
I turn it up, I got nothin' to lose
Get fucked up when it's nothin' to do, oh
No handouts, don't got nothin' for you, oh
Gun on my waist I got somethin' to prove

I'm in a mood, Cupid ready to shoot
Yeah, I'm ready to love, but I ain't ready to lose
You got a date with destiny, destiny ready for you
These bitches pressin' me, do I look like a button to you?
I was together when it started now I'm comin' a loose
Spit at Cupid in the face and now I'm runnin' from you
I went from talking about guns to lovin' on you
I keep it on me 'cause nobody takin' nothing from you, ooh

Every song turns to a love song, uh
I think that my life is a love song
Fuck around, got so high, it's a drug song
I love drugs so I guess it's still a love song
Every song turns to a love song, uh
I think that my life is a love song
Fuck around, got so high, it's a drug song
I love drugs so I guess it's still a love song, hey

I turn it up, I got nothin' to lose
Get fucked up when it's nothin' to do, oh
No handouts, don't got nothin' for you, oh
Gun on my waist I got somethin' to prove
I turn it up, I got nothin' to lose
Get fucked up when it's nothin' to do, oh
No handouts, don't got nothin' for you, oh
Gun on my waist I got somethin' to prove
