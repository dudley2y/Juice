808 Mafia

She told me that we perfect
So if we break up I'm gon’ turn into a serpent
She got a new nigga, well I'll be in they bushes lurkin'
With what? With a .40
What I’m gon' do? I'ma murk 'em

Uh, that's a play, I don't play, close the curtain
All this heart break shit blow, like his name Kurtis
All she ever do is do blow, and make me nervous
It's a AP not a Hublot, but let me stay focused
Lotti, Lotti you know, if you leave me
You askin' for the gun smoke, this is real, no cap, baby, no joke
You are my home, crack a smile when your name surfaces on my phone
Remember when I was in Europe, we was in a different time zone
Conversations what we still made time for
By the way I pop molly, I don’t rock Tom Ford
My hobbies are catchin’ bodies, riding bikes and skateboards
Instagram, like, "Look at Juice new girl"
Some of y'all is really fuckin’ with his new girl
But some of y'all are like, "Fuck her, that's his new girl"
Like who the hell invited her to live in Juice WRLD?
I think Juice WRLD invited her to live in Juice WRLD
That's Juice girl, nigga that’s not your girl
Uh, so with that being said, I'm holding her close and taking off clothes
And taking her soul, letting her know that she really make me whole

She told me that we perfect
So if we break up I'm gon' turn into a serpent
She got a new nigga, well I'll be in they bushes lurkin'
With what? With a .40
What I'm gon' do? I'ma murk 'em
