I think it's a plus
You think I'm a minus
Looking at the past
I leave that behind us
 in the glass
Looking at the time up
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Babygirl you time's up
I think it's a plus
You think I'm a minus
Looking at the past
I leave that behind us
 in the glass
Looking at the time up
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Babygirl you time's up
Oh

Told you that I don't care
When you hit me up
Probably I do care
When you showing up
You in my mind bae
When I'm pouring up
Waste all my time bae
Just don't waste my double-up
Leave that shit behind us
 in my heart I need some backup

I think it's a plus
You think I'm a minus
Looking at the past
I leave that behind us
 in the glass
Looking at the time up
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Babygirl you time's up


I think it's a plus
You think I'm a minus
Looking at the past
I leave that behind us
 in the glass
Looking at the time up
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Babygirl you time's up
