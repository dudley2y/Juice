Y'all niggas done fucked up, and it's a freestyle?
Huh, look

I swear I'm finna do these niggas bogus
I pop a Percocet, the perfect shit, I'm overdosing
Them bullets catch him lackin', throwing passes in the open
And make him disappear, I call it hocus, pocus
Freestyle shit, Ion even gotta write it
I just see the future like a motherfuckin' psychic
Stay strapped up like I'm finna join ISIS
All that talking, just do it like Nike
I ain't even wanna do this challenge, but I had to wreak some havoc on these niggas that thought they was on
Up that choppa if he talkin', bet it's gettin' him gone
And these niggas gon' be mad, this is off of the dome
I ain't even take time to write this down, 'cause this shit easy
I'm sick on this track, boy I'm straight sneezin'
Bullets give him ass-mud, got him straight wheezin'
Life's a bitch, fuck with me, I bet she straight leavin'

Heh
