(Enviyon on the mix)
(Nick-o on the beat)

Girl, you turn me cold (Oh)
I used to feel alone (Oh)
But now I got your friends
Callin' on my phone
I saw you in my dreams (In my dreams)
In my nightmares, I suppose (In my dreams)
I was holding you close (In my dreams)
I ain't want to let you go

Oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no), oh
Oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no), oh
Oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no), oh

It's time to break the rules (Ooh)
I get so faded, I can't move (I can't move)
I love playing games with love (I love playing your games)
But I hate it when I lose
Now I found my groove (Now I found my groove)
Wit the suicidal attitude (My new attitude)
Yeah, I love it when I crash (When I crash, when I crash)
I'm just waitin' for my doom (I'm just waitin' for my doom)
I'm falling, I'm fucked up
I'm faded, I'm so lit
These drugs make me feel famous
They also make me miss you (Miss you)
And all the shit we been through
You just a throwaway
Sailing in your sea of issues, I'm just a stowaway
I'm falling, I'm fucked up
I'm faded, I'm so lit
These drugs make me feel famous
They also make me miss you (Miss you)
And all the shit we been through
You just a throwaway
(Sailing in your sea of issues) I'm just a stowaway

No, woah (I'm fallin', I'm fucked up)
No, woah (I'm so lit, sedated)
No, woah (Sailing in your sea of issues, I'm just a stowaway)

Girl, you drive me cold (Oh)
I used to feel alone (Oh)
But now I got your friends
Callin' on my phone
I saw you in my dreams (In my dreams)
In my nightmares, I suppose (In my dreams)
I was holding you close (In my dreams)
I ain't want to let you go

Oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no), oh
Oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no), oh
Oh no (Oh no, oh no, oh no), oh

Oh no
I guess I need some liquor
Oh no
