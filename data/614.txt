Lyrics from snippet
Took it off his Twitter and his Tumblr
I know I'm goin' out and goin' under
My enteral slumber
As I turn the corner, evil on my radar
She said I should stay, baby girl, I'll stay high
Get up out the way, then I just say I didn't want to stay
Momma told me I should really leave the drugs alone
I know, but, no
Everyday I wake up to some bullshit on my phone
I know, but, no
Everyday I wake up to some bullshit on my phone
