Oh, oh, oh
Yeah

I'm fightin' off the demons in my sleep (Uh)
I pray to God my soul is his to keep
I'm fightin' off the demons in my sleep
I pray to God my soul is his to keep
Codeine sipper, Perc tipper
Fuckin' up my liver, now my liver
Doubt that I could shiver, shiver, shiver
The 'dro, it make me think I'm dyin' quicker

Devil in a red dress, she a dirty dancer
Hop around my head like a reindeer, Prancer
Thinkin' that you sway, but you don't have all the answers
So excuse my manners, gettin' high 'till I can't manage no more
I'm like planners, nutty like I'm Planters
Devil got a knife in her hand, she's a slasher
I know this 'cause I talk to God more than Ned Flanders
Still walkin' 'round, demons in my hand, dandruff

I'm fightin' off the demons in my sleep (Uh)
I pray to God my soul is his to keep
I'm fightin' off the demons in my sleep
I pray to God my soul is his to keep
Codeine sipper, Perc tipper
Fuckin' up my liver, now my liver
Doubt that I could shiver, shiver, shiver
The 'dro, it make me think I'm dyin' quicker

Here I am, wide open
On and off and off and on, potion
Wedding bells, ringing hell, frozen
Wishing wells, killing my wishes
I'm the worst, the baddest
Since the creation of cancer
I'm the worst, the baddest
Searchin' far and wide for some answers
Until then, I don't get no pics
In this building the demons look for me
I'ma fish, watch 'em reel in
That's just the way I been feelin'

I'm fightin' off the demons in my sleep (Uh)
I pray to God my soul is his to keep
I'm fightin' off the demons in my sleep
I pray to God my soul is his to keep
Codeine sipper, Perc tipper
Fuckin' up my liver, now my liver
Doubt that I could shiver, shiver, shiver
The 'dro, it make me think I'm dyin' quicker
