All through the midnight hour Runnin' from my fear
Shit, I feel like a coward Kryptonite killed all of my superpowers
My anxiety builds, I jump off the stress tower
Reachin' for the pills, I take Opiate showers
Growin' from my sins, then I plant it in flowers
Devil got me snortin' lines of enchantment powder
Life is a bitch & her lips taste sour

I find it fascinating that I'm high off my own supply
Buckle up, it's gon' be a long ride Knuckle up, these demons came to fight (oh)
Run a 'mok, 'mok, 'mok, cause a ruckus (ohh)
Had enough, 'nough, 'nough, screamin' "Fuck this" (ohh)
Yeah, Fuck this all
Life gets dirty, time for thе Lysol
Makin' crucial mistakes, yeah
I know it's my fault
You hate to look at my facе, yeah
I know it's my fault
You don't gotta tell me, I know I'm the cause
Surgery is needed, put away the gauze

All through the midnight hour Runnin' from my fear
Shit, I feel like a coward Kryptonite killed all of my superpowers
My anxiety builds, I jump off the stress tower
Reachin' for the pills, I take Opiate showers
Growin' from my sins, then I plant it in flowers
Devil got me snortin' lines of enchantment powder
Life is a bitch & her lips taste sour

Sometimes life flies over my head, yeah
It's out of my hands, yeah
Hard to comprehend that
I fall to my knees, tell God I'm callin' it quits
Went out of the misery business, 'cause I can't take it
Things ain't seem what they seem, they think it's easy to be me
I never let them see me bleed, I only let them see peace
Things ain't seem what they seem, they think it's easy to be me
I never let them see me bleed nor see me in pieces
I'm getting used to openin' up to people around me
I know that they're my family, they would do anything to help me
But they still don't know everything that is going on inside me
Even I don't know all the places my demons are hiding

All through the midnight hour Runnin' from my fear
Shit, I feel like a coward Kryptonite killed all of my superpowers
My anxiety builds, I jump off the stress tower
Reachin' for the pills, I take Opiate showers
Growin' from my sins, then I plant it in flowers
Devil got me snortin' lines of enchantment powder
Life is a bitch and her lips taste sour
