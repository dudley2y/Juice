She put on the Prada, ain't that what the devil wear?
Balenciaga goddess, when I call you never there
I thought about you then I went and bought a couple pairs
This that sad shit, went and got some blue kicks

Ball my eyes out, ball like Tyler Ulis
Funerals for love, go and pick some tulips
Kissing poison baby think I need some new lips
In my mind, in my mind till I lose it (Hey)
Can't see straight
Got invited to the misery party, can't be late
Xanny Xanny it be getting me started, ándele
All these drugs to the face, still a sad face (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
