Adio
Nash effect

I need beans, I need lean, yeah, the codeine
Ran up out of Percs, so I'm taking morphine
We sit courtside, she still catching nose bleeds
Fuck 12, I ain't runnin' with the police
I take beans, with the lean, yeah, the codeine, ayy
All these drugs got me dying, baby, slowly, ayy
On the lowkey I be overdosing, ayy
It ain't my fault that a nigga lonely, ayy

All on my own
All on my own
Off the drugs I roam
Far from my home

Perky got me tweaking, I be tweaking
Caught my ex lurking, in my recents
Think that she a bad hoe, only decent
Lil' bitch you look thirsty, here take this semen
I can't forget, wait drugs they make me forget that's how it is
Yo bitch swallow all my kids, hollow my tips
Can't go for that hater shit, pull up I'm hot
Hell, I be on that Satan shit

I need beans, I need lean, yeah, the codeine
Ran up out of Percs, so I'm taking morphine
We sit courtside, she still catching nose bleeds
Fuck 12, I ain't runnin' with the police
I take beans, with the lean, yeah, the codeine, ayy
All these drugs got me dying, baby, slowly, ayy
On the lowkey I be overdosing, ayy
It ain't my fault that a nigga lonely, ayy
