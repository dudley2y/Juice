You got it, you can keep it forever (Ya dig?)

I'm a goner (Ya dig?), junkie baby (Hey)
Mixing pills with the liquor got a nigga faded (Hey)
Off the shrooms, so my room look like different places
Lookin' in the mirror, ayy, I see different faces
Wake up then I see you (Ya dig?), but you're not there (Hey)
Maybe you're a ghost ho (Ya dig?)
But I'm not scared (Hey)
Love is not fair (Hey)
Love is not clear (Ya dig?)
But it still shines (Hey)
Like a chandelier (Shine shine)
If your still mine by the end of the year (Yeah)
Then I'll be fine
But when you're not here I go out my mind (Yeah)
I guess pussy's power right, word to felines (Hey hey hey)

I'm falling apart, no I can't keep it together (Ya dig?)
If I gave you my heart then you can keep it forever (Hey)
