I'm going to fuck her for the summer, ain't no cuddling
I've been balling every day, I'm triple doubling
My stats is doubling, my stats is tripling

Aight, I'm sippin' actavis, coming out of the bottle
I got my dick, I put it in a model
She said she sucks it, shawty finna swallow
I got a 40 40, fill with hallows
Fuck with me, kill him like it's Grand Theft Auto
Shoot you in your face, you will never see the day tomorrow
I get the cash, whatchu watching, sorrow
I got some 4's 4's, you can borrow
I got some 4 O's, you can borrow
I know some mozos, that been trapping
I know some hoes, like some stones
Some fo's that been getting money
Oh woah, wait, time to catch my flow
I feel like I'm Michael Jordan
In the 4th court, hit him with the floater
I been high on the Percocets
So mix it up with a potion
That shit like a book
When it comes to hugs, cause I keep it open
I'm like Michael Phelps
When I feel it in the bitch, I'ma deep stroke it
Shawty got a good mouth, talk
Good game, nigga deep-throatin'

Pull up to the scene, feel like Eazy-E

Ain't talkin' 'bout Urkel but bitch, I know that you know that all of my family matters
