G-Money you hear me fool? I'm finna eat!
Max Lord you hear me fool? I'm finna eat! Ha!

Fucking hoes we ain't calling, or talking
They follow us, they get to stalking
She gonna top me up, right after I park it
She asked to hit my blunt, bitch I just sparked it
This-this that Kimbo og, this that cough shit
I bought a zip of that stank, smell like toxic
Hair trigger on that choppa like a off switch
Red beam on your head, you a target (you a target)
I walk my shit, I don't talk it
I'm a dog, bite down, I don't bark it
Omega Psi Phi if we fighting

Put the slimes on your ass like Bompton
Fuck nigga cross the line, then it's slaughter
Old niggas hold on to your daughters
Cause if she hear one song that bitch a goner

That's a Benzo Xan for the dumb niggas that ain't never understand
I done took a lot of Xans
Cut it out for a while, get back on 'em, time to relapse again

Cut it out for a while, get back on 'em, time to relapse again
Cut it out for a while, get back on 'em, time to relapse again

Passed out at her house, woke up sleeping on the front lawn again
