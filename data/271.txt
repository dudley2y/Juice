So many drugs in my body, I'm exhausted
I got thugs in the lobby, in the club, fuck your posse
Fuck with me, I leave you sitting in a coffin
Bullets eating up your body, one to the head, now you silent
I remember window shopping, now I cop shit
So much Gucci in my closet, banded up fuck a wallet
All my fans telling me that I should drop shit
What you want? I got options, fifty albums in my pocket

Artist of the motherfucking year
People scream my name from London to Japan
Codeine sip, I don’t want no fucking beer
Everywhere I go, they know I'm the fucking man
I get so high I won't ever land
LA in the summertime, get a fucking tan
But I don’t go outside at all

That shit be having my girl pissed off
Sorry, I'm antique, but for her love I'm antsy
Everyday wanna get in her panties
Every night in the stu' making Grammies
Just gave fifty bands to my mommy
Just gave ten bands to my auntie
You couldn't do that if you worked your whole life
I know why you're worried 'bout me, nigga, you don't got your own life
Hollering at my bitch like you ain’t got your own wife
They tell me if I take too many of these Percs, then I’m gon' die
Fuck it, I’ma pray to god for a long life
Still gon' live a wrong life

So many drugs in my body, I'm exhausted
I got thugs in the lobby, in the club, fuck your posse
Fuck with me, I leave you sitting in a coffin
Bullets eating up your body, one to the head, now you silent
I remember window shopping, now I cop shit
So much Gucci in my closet, banded up fuck a wallet
All my fans telling me that I should drop shit
What you want? I got options, fifty albums in my pocket

Artist of the motherfucking year
People scream my name from London to Japan
Codeine sip, I don't want no fucking beer
Everywhere I go, they know I’m the fucking man
I get so high I won't ever land
LA in the summertime, get a fucking tan
But I don't go outside at all
