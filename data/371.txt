Who brought the devil in here? (Yeah, yeah, ayy)
Demons hold onto her hair (Yeah, yeah, ayy)
She's like the girl in the mirror (Yeah, yeah, ayy)
Except she don't disappear (Yeah, yeah, ayy)
She told me put my love over there (Yeah, yeah, ayy)
She told me leave my love over there (Yeah, yeah, ayy)
She told me put my love over there (Yeah, yeah, ayy)
She told me leave my love over there (Yeah, yeah, ayy)

She only comes out when it's dark
She told me, "Watch out for the narcs"
She hidin' all the drugs over here
Police come and she put it in hair
Police come, put it in her derrière
I want love, but the shit is never there
Look fear in the face, but I swear I'm never scared
The devil wantin' me, but I ain't ever care
I sell my soul then I go right and take it back
I knock 'em out, these demons want a boxing match
She broke my heart and now we sitting chest to chest
Letting our hearts fight, I call that a heart attack, yeah
What you said can't take it back, yeah
Matter fact keep that
Then give me some feedback
All my demons, I'm starting to feed that

She told me what to do and I ain't listen
I look at her as a competition
Even though she is my better half
I'ma still have the last laugh
Blew up in her face, love like Baghdad
If she swallow my kids, that make me a bad dad
Bitch told me that she love me, I ain't say the shit back
But I was thinkin' it, yeah, yeah
On her Twitter pics, yeah, yeah
Should've retweeted it, yeah, yeah
I really should've let her know
That I don't love no other ho
