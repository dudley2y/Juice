Lyrics from Snippet

Lost in the abyss, over a bitch (Damn)
Lost in the abyss, over a bitch (Ooh)

Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done (Uh)
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
What have you done? (What have you done?)
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
Bitch you are done (Bitch you are done)
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
I'm not the one, I'm not the one, bitch, I'm not the one

I will not fall inside of your abyss
I will not fall for the go-around
But what comes around, bitch, goes around
Karma's a bitch, and God has an ugly frown
I know that first-hand, and soon you will too, too, too
You will catch smoke by the second hand
Cancer is coming to you, you, you

Time is up, time is up, time is up, the time is up
Bitch, you're done, Bitch, you're done, Bitch, you're done
In the abyss, I'm out

Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done (Uh)
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
What have you done? (What have you done?)
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
Bitch you are done (Bitch you are done)
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
I'm not the one, I'm not the one, bitch, I'm not the one
