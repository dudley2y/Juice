Machete
Cut em' to pieces
In pieces
Hope this Perc beatin' me
Barely breathin'
I'm high off the finest lean
I feel like I'm an eagle
You think you a big shot, huh?
I'ma put a bullet hole in your ego
God damn, I love my slatts
But no, I don't fuck with these people
Bitch I'm a Pit off the leash (Yeah)
Got yo' ho gassed up
Still fucked her on E (Oh yeah)
New Bentley truck, red seats (Oh yeah)
Ain't even keep the receipt (Oh yeah)
Runnin' the game, no cleats (Yeah)
All this green it clicks (Yeah)

All my guns got a cold, I'm gon' make em' sneeze
She say my wrist is enchanting (Uh)
If you stare too long you'll get brain freeze
That pussy so good she can't leave
No Limit gang, shout out Maneski
And G-Money and Kyro and Bibby and all of my niggas that's gang-gang
They'd kill for me, they'd drill for me, and for them I'd do the same thing
Oh, yeah, that's real
Tryna get rich, you get in the way, you killed
Sippin' the lean while I'm grabbin' the wheel
Crash the Lambo', I'll still live
Turn into Rambo, I'll load up the clip

Doper than a relapse, relapse, every time I put the Percs down, I relapse

Tweakin'
Hope this Perc beatin' me
Barely breathin'
I'm high off the finest lean
I feel like I'm an eagle
You think you a big shot, huh?
I'ma put a bullet hole in your ego
God damn, I love my slatts
But no, I don't fuck with these people
Bitch I'm a Pit off the leash (Yeah)
Got yo' ho gassed up
Still fucked her on E (Oh yeah)
New Bentley truck, red seats (Oh yeah)
