Pull up on you, Hummer with the tints
And a .40 stick hotter than the summer when it hits

Keep that shit 100, I don't walk I run it
Ball like OKC no thunder
Shit on him no plunger, pipe up like a plumber
Just took his girlfriend nigga that's a bummer
Took a couple perkys with some strong marijuana
Yeah I got it on me run up on me if you wanna
You don’t want smoke nigga you don't want cancer
Lookin' like Sway bitch you don't got answers
Brand new kicks bought a hundred of them
Fifteen racks that's a lot of money to him
Let the broke niggas hate while I go and get a Phantom
Ghost, pull up on him like Danny Phantom, ho

Pull up on you, Hummer with the tints

Come and get your bitch I already hit her like a lick
Fuck her off the shrooms, got the room spinnin' in a bitch
Real rock-star call me John Lennon in a bitch
Got Versace and Gucci all on my linens in this bitch ayy
Don't talk shit, is it really worth the risk?
Dumb bitch, heard your nigga was a bitch too
Full clip, bitch I'm waiting for an issue
VVS, my shit colder than an igloo ayy
Bad lil’ bitch told her come my way
Fuck her all night kick her out broad day
All I do is ball MJ MJ
.40 make him moonwalk ayy MJ
I been gettin’ money everything's okay
Please get the fuck out my way, my way
Choppa make him hyperventilate
Please don’t make a real nigga demonstrate
