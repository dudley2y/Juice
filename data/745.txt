Lyrics From The Snippet

I told her that may be cool
But I'd really need my liver and kidneys, wow

I've been getting high high high high
Tryna touch the sky sky sky sky
It's funny how the time flies flies flies flies
I'm not the sober type of guy guy guy guy
Wow, I've been living fast fast
Feeling really bad bad
Time really moves fast fast
Then come and give me your bag, bag
Woah, woah
Fast fast
Feeling really bad bad
Molly and a two's, feeling really bad bad bad bad
