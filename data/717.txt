Southside on the track, yeah
Yeah, Southside

Guess I'll be hurting forever
Heaven's a prison forever
Said that you love me, whatever
I just don't know any better
In the studio writing you letters
I'ma be worried forever
Maybe it's all for the better
Or maybe it's all for nothin'
But I won't call for nothin'
Ain't waitin' on your girl, I won't stall for nothin'
I know you think about me
But bitch I'm out of your reach
You liked one of my tweets
I made that shit last week
You lackin' all on me
Pockets on big like 
Practice what I preach
I drop a one in my lean

I really lose a dream
Know how to lose a dream
I met you in my dreams
Know how to lose a dream
In Hollywood looking for freaks
I peruse the scene
Anti-social me
I spend a million in peace
I really lose a dream
Know how to lose a dream
I met you in my dreams
Know how to lose a dream
I peruse the scene
Anti-social me
I spend a million in peace

I made a million in weeks
I make my songs for the weak
I'm on the perkys, so I'm not hurting
Bitches went through my heart and my head
Gucci cost me an arm and a leg
Another heartbreak, blood all on my clothing
My fans nosy, they wanna know what's wrong with me
Do they really or do they wanna make a song with me
I bought new Dior, one week later that dirty
Dirty like these hoes, 
I already know that these bitches lurking
Pull up to my show
Battles if I roll
Keep them on they toes
Love and let them go, fuck it
My heart is exposed, fuck it

I really lose a dream
Know how to lose a dream
I met you in my dreams
Know how to lose a dream
In Hollywood looking for freaks
I peruse the scene
Anti-social me
I spend a million in peace
I really lose a dream
Know how to lose a dream
I met you in my dreams
Know how to lose a dream
I peruse the scene
Anti-social me
I spend a million in peace
