Lyrics from snippet

Run up he get dis-figured
Keep the .30 on me in the clip nigga

I could never switch nigga
Heard your boyfriend was a bitch nigga
If you run up he get dis-figured
Keep the .30 on me in the clip nigga (Ayy)
Perky with the liq-our
Have a lil nigga feelin' big-ger
I'm so high I can't get up
Codeine give a nigga hiccups
Put your hands in the air, stick up
He a broke nigga, need a fix-up
He a ho nigga, need a pill, huh
Big gun, walk with a limp, uh
I want a big house in the hills, uh
With a cabinet full of pills, uh
I don't really like cheap thrills, oh
So that's why I go out and get real ones

I don't think there’s any real ones
So I went and then I bought a new gun
She said she lookin' for a new man, I was out tryna kill one
Load it up, ayy, percocet pop 'til I'm throwing up, ayy
Codeine cup got me pouring up, uh
She a D cup, motorboat her, huh
She wanna be cracked let 'em run I'll hold em up
I was in my feelings too much tryna open up
Crashed my car so I had to get a new one
Benjamin Franklin, I count it up I need the blue ones
Fuck niggas talking about they tough but never do nun
Fuck niggas barking just like a pit but never bite nothin'
If he wanna fight .40 bite like Tyson
I said I'd make it bite Mike Tyson
He done ran up on the wrong one
Oops I mean the right one

I could never switch nigga
Heard your boyfriend was a bitch nigga
If you run up he get dis-figured
Keep the .30 on me in the clip nigga (Ayy)
Perky with the liq-our
Have a lil nigga feelin' big-ger
I'm so high I can't get up
Codeine give a nigga hiccups
Put your hands in the air, stick up
He a broke nigga, need a fix-up
He a ho nigga, need a pill, huh
Big gun, walk with a limp, uh
I want a big house in the hills, uh
With a cabinet full of pills, uh
I don't really like cheap thrills, oh
So that's why I go out and get real ones
