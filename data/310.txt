What else did they give you to drink?
So that's not drink?
No, I said, "What else did they give you to drink?
Uh, Bacardi
Oh, see that's why, you're out here mixin' shit (Haha)
Clear and cleared out, you ain't heard this shit
That's not how that works my love, haha
I miss you
I miss you
For real?
No, for real, for real
Oh
I wanna be there
Haha, I wanna be there
Ooh, I wanna be there
Mute yo self for a second

Girl come to me, come to me
I'ma come to you if you don't come to me
I'ma eat it good, girl, you better cum for me
It's just me and my tongue, tryna keep you company
I can't hold my tongue, baby, I think you're the one
This is a lot to say at once, uh
You probably think I'm dumb, I'm sayin' this shit too soon
Take your Xannies to this song, I'm off the Percs, I'm gone, wrong
I've been drinking strong, tryna leave the pills at home
I feel like I live in Hell, but for you I'm thankin' God
Maybe He sent you to me, that's what I'm tryna find out
I put the Percs down, hopefully it work out
Fit body, you work out, I hope we work out-out-out

Ain't no time outs, all night don't tap out
Last time you tapped out, in the pussy, I black out
I really like you, wait 'till the love come 'round
'Cause when my love is involved is when it all goes down
Make you tap out, uh, blow your back out, uh
Guess you're tired-tired-tired, put them Xans down, out
You keep me hard-hard-hard, put them Percs down, out
Teach me what you know baby, give me a work out
I'm a freak, in the sheets, I'm a freak, I'm a geek
Don't take this brain from me, I'ma need that brain for keeps
You could be my main thing, ain't no sides
Pickin' sides, you and I
You got me, you got my love for free, baby
That's a guarantee, baby
Spread your legs, I'll feast, baby
Wake you out of your sleep, baby
You know I won't get sleep, baby
Let me fuck you to pieces

Baby come to me, come to me
I'ma come to you if you don't come to me
I'ma eat it good, girl, you better cum for me
It's just me and my tongue, tryna keep you company
I can't hold my tongue, baby, I think you're the one

I want to explore you, uh
Girl let me adore you, uh
I don't want to annoy you
I've been fiending girl, I want to sexually destroy you, uh
Up in the shower, we ain't have no lights
Next time, girl, ride it like a bike, fuck it, ride it all night
You got that mindset that I like, uh, you a ride-or-die
I'm drivin' myself brazy, fantasizing about last time, uh, uh
Got a couple of homies in here
I know you can smell the love in the air
Told them to get them hoes outta here
If I don't take Percs then I feel scared
Not when you right here, when it comes to you, I care
When I'm not with you, don't nobody talk to me, don't dare

Girl come to me, come to me
I'ma come to you if you don't come to me
I'ma eat it good, girl, you better cum for me
It's just me and my tongue, tryna keep you company
