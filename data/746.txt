My life is unreal and I just go ghost
They say my life deserve a camera, I'm a GoPro
 where it's cold cold, yeah baby, too cold
I'm jumping like Jordan with my money 
Still in Dior clothes, I'm on the block, ho
Shots hit your spine, leave you lying in your chanclas

Let's take it to the basics (Yeah)
Five gram wood, roll it up, face it (Yeah)
Feeling damn good, legend in the making
Percocet chasing
Feeling wasted, wasted, on daily basis
999, different world we facing
Shoutout to that boy, Kid LAROI
Killer in the making
 you ever knew, noise we'll bе making
Young nigga's up and got the old niggas hating
Peek-a-boo from my label
Niggas picking raising
I'll get back to thеm later, I'm busy achieving greatness
 im'a laser for Glizzy is aim amazing
Hope you don't get in the way, we get busy, leave you on the pavement

My life is unreal and I just go ghost
They say my life deserve a camera, I'm a GoPro
 where it's cold cold, yeah baby, too cold
I'm jumping like Jordan with my money 
Still in Dior clothes, I'm on the block, ho
Shots hit your spine, leave you lying in your chanclas

Pills all the time 
Pain in my mind and my heart 
Substance abuse, could've help me harder

My life is unreal and I just go ghost
They say my life deserve a camera, I'm a GoPro
 where it's cold cold, yeah baby, too cold
I'm jumping like Jordan with my money 
Still in Dior clothes, I'm on the block, ho
Shots hit your spine, leave you lying in your chanclas
