Roaming through my head, roaming
Roaming through my head
Living in the damn moment
Double cup couldn't swim, drown in it
Purple over my head
A high tide and a Hi-Tech bounce
Set me free, let me free, I can't breathe, let me be, be
I'm burning up, I'm freezing out
I'm sweating, my brain spazzing out
My contract with the devil has ran out
Renew it when I'm up at the plug house
Running through my brain looking for this feeling called safety
I'm not insane but I'm on my way, there's no debating
It's not a game, my picture frame
It slowly change, it's not the same
Roaming through my head, roaming
Roaming through my head
Living in the damn moment
Double cup couldn't swim, drown in it
Purple over my head
A high tide and a Hi-Tech bounce
Set me free, let me free, I can't breathe, let me be, be
I'm burning up, I'm freezing out
I'm sweating, my brain spazzing out
My contract with the devil has ran out
Renew it when I'm up at the plug house
Running through my brain looking for this feeling called safety
I'm not insane but I'm on my way, there's no debating
It's not a game, my picture frame
There's no change, it's not the same
Living in the damn moment
