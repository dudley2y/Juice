They ask me how high am I
Wheezy outta here

They ask me how high am I, I said I'm higher than this
They say, "You could die like this"
They ask me if I'm in love, I said in love like a bitch
They said I could die like this
I asked them what'd happen if I take two shots of the gin
After all the percs I did
I asked them what happens if I put a hole in his head
He was talkin' all that shit

Damn, talkin' to the voices again, talkin' to the voices again
Talkin' to the voices again, talkin' to the voices again
Talkin' to the voices again, talkin' to the voices again, again

My conscience haunts me like a ghost in an old house
Tell me what you know 'bout the pain, what you know 'bout?
Tell me you know how it feels to never wanna go out, uh
Anti, percs to the, got me scratchin'
Ain't no such thing as relaxin' without relapsing
Does someone have a pill bottle they can pass me?

Damn, talkin' to the voices again, talkin' to the voices again
Talkin' to the voices again, talkin' to the voices again
Talkin' to the voices again, talkin' to the voices again, again (Wheezy outta here)

If it isn't one thing then it's definitely the other
I get so high off of percocets, I start seeing different colors
I get so high off of lean, everything in slow motion to me
Everything's just how it's supposed to be
So high, it's heavenly
I put love and drugs in the same box
Girl, you better off dodgin' raindrops
Thinkin' you was finna get me off the straight drop
That's a cap, that's a hell nah
Live my life like San Andreas
Let a nigga try to take it
We'll hang him like we racist
After that, we'll send him to satan

Damn, talkin' to the voices again, talkin' to the voices again
Talkin' to the voices again, talkin' to the voices again
Talkin' to the voices again, talkin' to the voices again, again
