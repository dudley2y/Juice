I ain't one to leave, but girl you pressure me
I know you got the worst and the best of me
If we gon' play love games, girl, lets play for keeps
But if you bein' serious, don't play with me

Yeah, I've been through hell, whoa
Yeah, I lived in a hell hole
I have no more control
I shoot for the stars, I reload
She is the reason for my suffering
She is the reason for my buffering
We are stuck on the same thing
We are stuck on the same things

I ain't one to leave, but girl you pressure me
I know you got the worst and the best of me
If we gon' play love games, girl, lets play for keeps
But if you bein' serious, don't play with me


I ain't one to leave, but girl you pressure me
I know you got the worst and the best of me
If we gon' play love games, girl, lets play for keeps
But if you bein' serious, don't play with me
