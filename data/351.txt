Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh
Skrt, skrt, skrt

I got drive like four wheels
In my mind off four pills
No I can't feel
Blurry vision at the steering wheel (Yeah)
But I'ma steer it still (I can't)
'Cause you gotta die to live (Skrt, skrt, skrrt)
I got drive like four wheels
In my mind off four pills
No I can't feel (I can't)
Blurry vision at the steering wheel (Yeah)
But I'ma steer it still (Yeah)
'Cause you gotta die to live

Taking risk after fucking risk, after fucking risk
I remember I had to water whip, almost fucked my wrist up
Now its houses in the fucking hills, rich as fuck for real
'Member she ain't let me fuck her then, now she gon' let me get some
Droppin' the Wock in the fruit punch
'Member rockin' the Robins and toting guns
And I got ice like Toboggan and drip like a faucet
It's Gucci my ooh, Gucci my closet
You better not try to rob us, my niggas ridin'
Double R truck I pull up they inside it
Bought my bitch a new watch I knew she was excited
To shine on these bitches that hate that she got it
Haters gon' hate everyday I don't doubt it
Success make a hater go straight suicidal
I'm smokin' exotic, my car is exotic
My girl is exotic, she solvin' my problems
I was hangin' with killers and drillers and dealers
And thieves, and juggers, finessers and robbers
I got rich I'm still hangin' with killers and drillers
And thieves, finessers, them juggers and robbers (Skr, skr, skrr)

I got drive like four wheels
In my mind off four pills
No I can't feel (I can't)
Blurry vision at the steering wheel (Yeah)
But I'ma steer it still (Yeah)
'Cause you gotta die to live (Skrt, skrt, skrrt)
I got drive like four wheels
In my mind off four pills
No I can't feel (I can't)
Blurry vision at the steering wheel (Yeah)
But I'ma steer it still (Yeah)
'Cause you gotta die to live

Uh
I touch the ceiling off the perc
Remember when I was stealing all the percs
Remember when I was moving all the work
Remember when I was covered in sin I ain't know what to do, I was making shit work
Funeral service, my niggas leavin' earth
No one was there when my dick was in the dirt
No one was there when my bro was in a hearse
I made it far, yeah, yeah, yeah
Had to give it my all, yeah, yeah, yeah
From the way that I ball, shots that I call
All of them fall, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't go in the mall, why
'Cause I think I been bought it all, right
But the money don't catch my fall
No one's there when I call, right

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh
Skrt, skrt, skrrt

I got drive like four wheels
In my mind off four pills
No I can't feel (I can't)
Blurry vision at the steering wheel (Yeah)
But I'ma steer it still (Yeah)
'Cause you gotta die to live (Skrt, skrt, skrrt)
