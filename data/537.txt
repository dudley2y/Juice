Lyrics from Snippet

...
She kept my love locked up like a slave
I was trapped in a love cage

Her love and heroin the same thing
I can't deal with this sober, I'm getting shit-faced
Rip my heart out then I put it on a mix-tape
I can never win with love like a sweepstakes
Fallen out, let me down, I can't ball outta bounds
Run it up, drip me down and I keep a young gunner, drip or drown It takes too much loving to kill ya', let me get outta my feelings
I look at her as a dealer, I look at her as a healer
Spent a few K on a makeup, I bet she love her concealer
She know that I love drugs, look at her paraphernalia...
