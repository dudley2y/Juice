I think I'm hooked on the motions (Yeah)
I'm in too deep like the ocean (Yeah)
I know I'm lost in the moments (Yeah)
Baby, I do not condone this (Yeah)
But I've been drinkin' and smokin' (Yeah)
You think it's funny, I'm jokin' (Yeah)
But I'm so serious, without you I am delirious, yeah
I think I'm hooked on the motions (Yeah)
I'm in too deep like the ocean (Yeah)
I know I'm lost in the moments (Yeah)
Baby, I do not condone this (Yeah)

You think it's funny, I'm jokin' (Yeah)
But I'm so serious, without you I am delirious, yeah

I put my heart in the backpack
Packin' my shit up to leave
No, I won't look back
Drama be lookin' for me
Baby where you at?
That's where I wanna be
That's where I wanna be, yeah
Let's go to lunch we can eat there
Got a hotel we can sleep there
I'm only sleeping if you're there
Girl, I'm so happy that you care
Runnin' my fingers through your hair
Ready for love, I am not scared
But I'll be scared if I open my eyes and you not there (Yeah, hell yeah)

I think I'm hooked on the motions (Yeah)
I'm in too deep like the ocean (Yeah)
I know I'm lost in the moments (Yeah)

I really want you next to me
Fuckin' you, givin' you what's left of me (skrr, skrr)
God keep blessin' me (oou)
Give me good head, stop stressin' me
CÃ©line Frame sauce, with the recipe (oou)
Bad, bad, bad bitch on me
Why you gotta stress me?
Why you gotta stress me? (ew)
Overseas, yeah with a bad one (with a bad one)
Wanna get your hair done (hair done)
CDG on my hoodie (let's go)
Baby on me, what's goodie (oou)
Got a couple plaques on the wall (hey)
Bank account fat, never fall
Put it on the line for you
With that song with Juice

I think I'm hooked on the motions (Yeah)
I'm in too deep like the ocean (Yeah)
I know I'm lost in the moments (Yeah)
