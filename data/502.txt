Told her that I'm running out of patience
She got way too many complications
It feel like I’m going out with Satan
Hell's hot but she's hotter, she’s hotter
Told her that I'm running out of patience
She got way too many complications
It feel like I'm going out with Satan
Hell's hot but she's hotter, she's hotter

Mixing pills with the potions
She really got a young nigga open
She really got a young nigga hoping
Floating, hopeless, flying lotus
Hocus pocus but ain't no magic tricks
Just a magic bitch
I ain't really got no time, tock tick
She all on my mind, stop it
This relationship toxic
I can’t fake it till I make it anymore dog
Popping pills until I’m passed out on the floor dog
I told my lady I'm so high that I see four of y’all
That got me aroused
Come and love me down
Evil girl

She got way too many complications
It feel like I'm going out with Satan
Hell's hot but she's hotter, she’s hotter
Told her that I'm running out of patience
She got way too many complications
It feel like I'm going out with Satan
Hell's hot but she's hotter, she's hotter


She got way too many complications
It feel like I'm going out with Satan
Hell's hot but she's hotter, she's hotter
Told her that I'm running out of patience
She got way too many complications
It feel like I'm going out with Satan
Hell's hot but she's hotter, she's hotter
