It's funny, the shit I put on this song ain’t gon' sound nothin' like the shit we was just doin’
Oh, yeah
I just want bad bitches
Baddest, them bitches is the baddest, uh, uh
When I take the molly, I'm a savage
Uh, I say, uh

I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh, uh
She the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her, I'm the definition of a bandit, uh, ayy
I don't need no molly to be savage, uh, ayy
But when I'm on the molly, I feel savage
Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her heart, I'm the definition of a bandit

Put the Percs down and picked up the jiggas, jiggas, jiggas
Tommy in the fucking Tommy Hilfiger, ’figer, ’figer
That Tommy hit a nigga, Tommy Hilfiger, fuck niggas
I'm nice, when I’m high off the pills, I'ma fuck with her
I don't smoke skunk, but tonight I'm getting stuck, nigga
Pour the codeine up and put some molly in the cup with it
I know she a freak, uh-huh, she gon’ fuck with it
She my velcro, uh-huh, guess I'm stuck with her
I dive in it like a sailor, I love to nail her
Addicted to her paraphernalia, I had to tell her
I see it like a fortune teller
Your ex-nigga did good, I could do better
Bad bitch from the woods, I think she a hunter
She a killer and an eater, she a Jeffrey Dahmer
She gon' whip it with the beater, she a Betty Crocker
All she care about is money, R.I.P. to Speaker Knockerz
Thinkin 'bout it so much, I forgot to put the hook
I can tell when she in her feelings, I can read her like a book
This is chess, no checkers, I'ma play her like a rook
No TEC, no Beretta, FN on me, am I understood?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh, uh
She the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her, I'm the definition of a bandit, uh, ayy
I don't need no molly to be savage, uh, ayy
But when I'm on the molly, I feel savage
Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her heart, I'm the definition of a bandit

I switch clips like she switch bitches
I forgot to mention that my bitch fuck bitches
I forgot to mention, she don't fuck with fuck niggas
It's just me and her against the world screamin' "Fuck niggas"
Like a virgin or somethin', no, you can't fuck with me
My .40 velcro or somethin', 'cause it's stuck with me
You run up on me, Kel-Tec give you a buck fifty
I told Thug I need some HiTech, gon' and fuck with me
Sip it out a wine glass, this ain't not no Remi', Remi'
Get over here with your fine ass, I done had too many, many
Codeine out the wine glass, I done drunk too many, many
Left the choppa at home, so you know I got the semi with me
When I'm in my city, got a couple bad bitties with me
I mean when I'm in my bity, got a couple bad bitties with me
I came from the trenches, I done lost too fuckin' many, many
Can't save her, she done went and fucked too many, many
One-of-one watch, what that cost? Like one fifty
Ménage à trois with your bitch, fucked too many
Freestyle flows, I don't ever use no pen to do it
This ain't no scrimmage game, why you puttin' on a pinny, pinny?
.40 with Amiri, hold it up with the Fendi, Fendi
I'm in Atlanta and yes, I got the chopper with me, with me
Short barrel AR, leave you in the graveyard
You want beef hollow tip make you bleed steak sauce

I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh, uh
She the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her, I'm the definition of a bandit, uh, ayy
I don't need no molly to be savage, uh, ayy
But when I'm on the molly, I feel savage
Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her heart, I'm the definition of a bandit
