Guess everybody wants me dead
Bitch I'm already dead
I've been dead for years
You can see the pain in my laugh
Demons coming back from the past

...on my suffering
It's really killing under my skin
Maybe I should try to pray again
Try'na wash away my sins
I know that they not my friends
But I’m friends with the drugs again
Lost my heart, lost it all
So much drama, multiplier
She's like a soap opera, straight down fire
Nightmares on the cellphone, late night calls
