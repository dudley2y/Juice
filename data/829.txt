Okay, Hit-Boy, you the shit, boy
Me and you make some songs and get rich, boy (Woo)
I just told you I've been paying my mama rent, boy (Ooh)
That's the best money that I ever spent, boy (C'mon!)
I'ma pull up in an all black Benz, boy
Sippin' codeine with my black friends, boy (Uh huh)
I'ma pull up on the facade she live boy (Hey!)
Every day you know I'm bound to get it in, boy (Yeah!)
Me and Charlie Sloth gettin' to this money all day (Okay)
Rockin' Ksubi and Amiri, yeah, I don't do the Balmains (Uh)
Knock it out the park, and we talkin' a ball game
Like I said, Barack Obama, I'm really with all change (Uh huh)
Charlie got the Vikings on his shirt, I'm like a Viking (Woof)
Fuck a bitch and leave hеr, guess I'm a little too triflin' (Oof; Perfеct)
I'ma Mike & Ike it, I'ma Mike & Ike it
Fist up with the clip tuck, good at fightin'
Knock 'em out in one or two punches, I'm Tyson
Listen to the next project you better buy it (Mm)
It's gon' be the realest shit you heard, I ain't lyin'
It's gon' be the realest shit you heard, I ain't lyin' (Yeah!)
I'm defyin' 2012, and it's real like the Mayans
Kill every beat and I ain't even really tryin'
I'ma tell the truth, no frontin', no lyin'
I bop to survive, my flow is the hottest
The highest, the fliest
Flyer than a pilot, my gun a library and it got a silence
But I still want Santa-ty in a piece, so
So I'll do anything to kill all the violence
But back in Chicago is bustin'
Niggas really shooting guns like the shit is nothing
Killing mom's kids and children, but this shit is disgusting
We gon' need more than a talk, more than a discussion
All I know is get the cash, yeah, get the cash
Catch up, tell them niggas, "Catch up"
They gon' need some backup
Remember hittin' stains like mustard and ketchup
Now I'm 200 miles per hour, they won't catch us

If you can, but you can't
I'm the motherfucking champ
You ain't Triple 9, then fuck you, get the fuck out my camp
Niggas thinking that they in it
They always come and doubt until I ball like a warrior
Switch up like I'm Durant
I'm a shoot from the three, niggas can't fuck with me
Not with the fuckery
Hotter than the summer be
Niggas really think they spell it out
But I'ma spell it clearly
Like a nigga gettin' an "A" and doing a fucking spelling bee
