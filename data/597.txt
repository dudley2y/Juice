Lyrics from Snippets

...Don't hold hands, bad romance
Bad Romance, don't hold hands
Toxic kisses off the Xans
Bad Romance...
...
...Back of the car with the blunt to her lips
Never ever thought that I'd be getting high off a kiss
Grown man, heart-broke I thought Trix were for kids
Now I’m really thinking I won't find a lover again
You lied when you told me that you want it forever
I ball no matter the weather, it's forever
Another toxic love like, not again
Wash it down with klonopins
Give me one chance, let me...
