I
Ooh-ah

No trespassing, need privacy
I'm high, why won't you let me be?
I can't breathe
Need to link up, she could be my Zelda, uh
I don't need her, I still do shit to please her, uh
This not a ordinary woman, I personify the drug as a Percocet
An extraordinary woman, I take two of her then I feel the perfectness

My lil' bitch be takin' Percocets too
Sometimes I don't know what I should do
She wanna fuck, I told her to come through
I show her what the Percocets do, to me
Almost died last week, these drugs on a killing spree
They keep mе feeling free, oh (Oh, yeah)
Feeling free, oh (Feeling free, oh)
Oh (Feeling free, oh)
Oh (Got me feeling free, yeah)
Oh, feeling free

Tracin', hеart racin', go insane on the daily
Demons on me, pray to God for some saving
Choppa on me, pull it up, get to slaying
I grab my life by the horn like a bull on the yard
Life is a rodeo when it gets hard
Why you think people say bullshit?
You seeing what I did right there? That's a bar

No trespassing, need privacy
I'm high, why won't you let me be?
I can't breathe
Need to link up, she could be my Zelda, uh
I don't need her, I still do shit to please her, uh
This not a ordinary woman, I personify the drug as a Percocet
An extraordinary woman, I take two of her then I feel the perfectness
