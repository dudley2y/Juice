Lyrics from Snippet

Danny, I see you
Uh-huh, uh, uh-huh
I pray to Smith &
Help me keep me up, I can't
I pray to Smith &
Help me keep me up, I can't
Let's go

Stuck in my mind, oh yeah
I'm in my prime, oh yeah
Taking my time, oh yeah
Even though everything feels so fast
Losing my mind
But it's okay, it's fine
I'ma just keep gettin' high
Yeah, I'm tryna reach new heights

There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone

I wonder if anybody knows
I wonder if anybody notices
When I get in my head I feel alone
No, I don't think nobody really notices
Life don't seem so fair
Devil standing right, right there
Fuck it, you don't think I see you standing right there?
I guess I'm just too high to care
But at least I still...

There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone

There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone

Okay, I get it, I understand
There's people here to hold my hand
But what happens when, happens when, I can't comprehend someone holding my hand?
 on a joint
What I spent? 5 bands
A bunch of pills, Oxycode
Spend another 5 grand
I understand none of these drugs make the person I am
Sober up, I can't, sorry but I can't
We'll see tomorrow
The potency is sorrow
I was thinking hopefully, praying hopefully
There's some dope for me 'n' I could borrow

Soon shine from the finish line
Moon-
