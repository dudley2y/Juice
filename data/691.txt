Oh, it's a Hit-Boy joint, huh?
Yeah, okay, huh, okay, uh
Okay, uh, okay, mhm

Baby, I'm stuck in my ways
It's been a couple of days
I could fuck you for days
Guess I'm stuck in my ways
Yes, I'm young and I'm paid
So they hearts getting slayed
I'm a rebel, I'm a rockstar, take it to the grave, uh
Molly at the rave, yes I misbehave, uh huh
Molly at the rave, yes I misbehave, uh huh
I'm gon' do the dash on my dirt bike, fuck a Wraith
Everybody the same color to me, I'm screaming "Fuck a race!"
Anybody want a problem with me, they gon' get erased
My pencil, ayy
I got the life pencil, erase your ass away
Listen to the way I spit on it, huh
Look at this beat, I'ma get on it, huh
No hip-hop but I'ma spit on it, huh
Your girl said she gon' spit on it, huh
That nigga don't got shit on me, huh
That nigga fake, that nigga hate
Bitch, I am Givenchy, he Abercrombie, it's a difference that I make
All the money that I make is mine, just won't a nigga ever take
I don't really never take my time, especially when I be spitting lines
This is off the dome when I hit it
Freestyle, I ain't rippin' the written
Beat the pussy, I don't fuck with the kitten
In the cut probably holdin' a Smith &
That's Cupid, tryna make me shuffle like Cupid
No Nike, but I just do it
Juice WRLD, Triple 9, that's a movement
Yeah, molly at the rave, I misbehave
Hm, molly at the rave, I'm gon' misbehave
Freestyle a song on the radio, damn near everyday
Ayy, molly at the rave, I'm gon' misbehave
See, it's me and Charlie, we in the party
I'm feeling gnarly, I'm off a perky, mixed with the molly
If she want a train, I'll call a trolly
I get it popping
I'm Tony Hawk and I feel like a ollie
But I'm on a beat like a damn Kamikaze
I'm a rockstar, Black Sabbath, no Ozzy
Pull up in a Mazi, nigga can't stop me
Knock 'em out like Rocky
I'm young and rich and humble just ain't wanna be too cocky
But shit, muck around with my hand on my cock
Gun to the opps, run up get popped
I'm at the Gucci shop, buy what I want, yeah
Cause I deserve it, my flow is perfect (Perfect)
There's snakes in the grass, with my John Deer help me see the serpents
God gave me the sermon, he told me I earned it
I'm looking at the bridges that I'm tryna rebuild
Should've never burned 'em
That's life, it's trial and error, niggas is full of mistakes
I'm eating so good that I had to put VVS's on my plate
I'm working out my problems, my demons ain't in good shape
But I'm in better shape
Boxing the devil, like damn he didn't know I was a heavyweight
(He's heating up)
But still misbehave
Molly at the rave, still misbehave
Chains 'round my neck, I told you, I ain't finna be no slave
Put that on my grave
Molly at the rave, misbehave
