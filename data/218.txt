Off-White on the G-Fazo's
Her love's dead, think it needs a halo
I'm in my head, damn it, I think too much
Now I'm getting tear stains on the bankrolls
Bro said if she wanna leave, I should let go
Heart saying, "If she leave, we're going with her, let's go"
I don't wanna let go, girl from 7.3.4

Time, time heals all wounds
But time can leave the nastiest scars
This happened too soon
I'm starting to think that I don't know who ya' are
Pills get popped as your love gets stopped
You just sit and watch as I wheeze and cough
I can't breathe at all, I can't breathе it off
I can't breathe with all the pain involvеd

In the studio getting high with the bros
Eyes get big when I see you're texting my phone
Codependent, yeah, I hate being alone
And everyone knows
Now I got to deal with this rain again
The same rain that you made go away
Now I gotta deal with this heart-throbbin' pain again
The pain feel like it never go away
Girl, never say you can't forgive me for my mistakes
You do things to make me ache, but I love you so much
I'll wait for however long it takes
