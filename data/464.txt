This is my life, life, life
Cuff me up, read me my rights
I’m going to your jail tonight, sentence for life, sentence for life
(Life, life, life)
I won’t do you wrong i’ll do you right
You got the wet, you got the type, shit that I like
You just my type (type, type)
No training wheels when we move off
I’m pulling right, this is the best ride of your life, ride of you life
(Life, life, life)
Am I extreme if I say not having you is suicide
If you leave me i’m gonna die
Die, die, die
Let’s embark on, this journey that we on, this journey that we on
Let’s embark on, this journey that we on
Life, life, life

I need more of, more, more of
More of your love, can’t get enough, can’t get enough
I need more of, your love, Yee-haw

I’ma killer, killer for your love
You're a dealer, baby, you’re a healer, a revealer
I look at my ex and I see the difference
The definition of imperfect bitches
You make it clear, I got perfect vision
Your pussy hits wit my serpent in it
I don’t just fuck it, i’m lurking in it
I don’t just play, bitch, I’m working in it
I got some problems, I’m working on them
Thank god for you, you a problem solver
We went our separate ways, and then I left the country
Felt like a goner
I fall for you, like leaves in the autumn
You’re pretty, like the leaves in the autumn
I pray you never leave, we’re together
When I say together I mean forever, I mean forever
Ride me forever, ride me forever, ride me forever, ride me forever
I mean forever, ride me forever, ride me forever
I put in the effort to make myself so much better
After you make me so much better
And that’s forever

So I need more of, more, more of your love
Can’t get enough, I need more of, I need more of, more, more of your love
I need more of, more, more of, more of your love
Can’t get enough, I can’t get enough, I need more of, more, more of your love

Ooooooh
Oooooh oooh
Oh-oh
Yeah, Yee-haw
