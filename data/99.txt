What?
I don't know, I just wanted to hear your voice
Look at him
*Dogs barking*
Cute dog
Purps on the beat
She got dogs and shit in the background, mute yo self
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na
I tell her a-na-a-na-a-na

Her voice sounds like a stereo and it's up in my head
When she is not around, it feels like I'ma turn up dead
I'm calling on her phone, telling her I'm full of dread
I wish that she was here, playing in my dreads
She told me she really likes me, I hope it's not a fib
I told myself I wouldn't even go through the same shit again
She runnin', runnin' through my head like a race, she tryna win
But she don't know that she don't got no competition
I'm in Paris by myself, it feels like something's missin'
Ex girl on my phone, bitch why is you trippin'?
Leave me alone, I done moved on to somethin' different
I'm finally gettin' the feeling I was missin'
Uh, you came in like a hurricane
You tell me you ain't playin' at all, I'm still tryna figure out the games
Maybe there ain't no games to play in the first place
Maybe you a real one, we gon' see
Oh, and me? I'm real as can be
I want to eat your heart out figuratively
I've been feelin' different since you've been away from me
I'm tempted to get too high
And me? I'm real as can be
I'm tryna eat your soul out physically
Ain't scared to bring them poles out, you know how I roll out
But I got a soft spot for the girl that makes my heart drop
Uh, poles out, you know how I roll out
Yeah, I got a soft spot for the girl that makes my heart drop
I'll go all out, yeah, I'll go all out
I'll go all out, yeah, I'll go all out
Gucci on your wrist, you ain't think I've seen it
I wish you was here, everything is scenic
Having chest pains, feelin' like I'm endin'
This is real life, I am not pretendin'
Cupid got a gun at my head, finna pull it
I'ma stand here and take it ain't dodgin' bullets
This seems too good be to true, what's to it?
You told me that there ain't nothin' to it but to do it

Uh, so I'ma do that motherfucker if they try you
I'ma shoot a motherfucker, I love your vibes, ooh
I'ma do that motherfucker when I lay beside you
You know I wanna fuck her

My homie asked, "What's next? Do I like her, do I love her, do I want her?"
I wonder, if I give her my heart am I a goner?
She keep Backwoods rolled, she a stoner, she a stoner
Tattoos on her face, I kiss her ink under covers
Uh, get my tongue involved, she got me in awe, baby
Give me it all, uh, feel it in my draws, baby
All night long, you deserve an applause baby
Made me a better person already I didn't involve, baby
Tell me why my old hoes still tryna be involved, baby
I feel like you should load it up and shoot 'em in the jaw, baby
I was off the Xannies, calling your phone, feeling wrong, baby
Prolly 'cause you told me leave the Xannies alone, baby

Uh, so I'ma do that motherfucker if they try you
I'ma shoot a motherfucker, I love your vibes, ooh
I'ma do that motherfucker when I lay beside you
You know I wanna fuck her
Uh, so I'ma do that motherfucker if they try you
I'ma shoot a motherfucker, I love your vibes, ooh
I'ma do that motherfucker when I lay beside you
You know I wanna fuck her
