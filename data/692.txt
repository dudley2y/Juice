On the pills again, Percocet all day, fuck Vicodin
I'm sick of giving people shit to relate to
Life has turned into one big escape room
I don't wanna go there, I been there before
I don't wanna go there, is it too soon?
The doctor told me I'd be dead by next June
Unless I stop all these pills I'm into
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard to get to
The part, uh, uh, uh, uh (Uh, uh)
It's okay baby, I know I'm bound to die
I've been doing drugs since one three
Now I'm one nine, now I'm one nine

I'd do anything in my power to see you just smile
I want you to prosper and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side

Two sads dont make a smile, you canâ€™t turn it upside down
I'd do anything in my power to see if you smile
Make it worthwhile
Tell me what is happy
Ain't no escaping, ain't no escaping
This ain't Earth, this the birth place of Satan
Ain't no escaping, ain't no escaping
I tried to escape it but I hate it
In my complex, in my basic
Interfused with complex, very basic, shit I hate it

The worst thing I ever did was become famous
I'd take it back in a moment
If I could but I can't so I own it
Drugs, you could do them if you want, I don't condone it
Too much of lean, you fucked up
Too much cash, how you're stuck up
It's a stick up, everything yeah, I need it

Treat it like a change, bitch you know you can keep it
Lately I been changing, kept that shit a secret
Now I'm letting it out the cage, gotta let it breathe, yeah
Ain't the same as I was a day ago
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
Take the drugs, it feels like a miracle
Take the drugs and get a little spiritual, yeah
Frequencies get lower as I get higher (as I get higher)
My frequency gets lower as I get higher (as I get higher)
(mumbling)
Everybody tells me the day I die im gonna go dance in fire (in fire, its whatever)
Yeah those words haunt me like a bad dream or a ghost (Yeah)
(mumbling)
I know I sometimes do the most
Yeah, my apologies

Claiming that I got good philosophy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh)
But honestly, I am confused as the next being, cause i ain't by your side
The clothes don't help at all
The clothes don't help at all
The drugs and the hoes don't help at all
(mumbling)

Ain't no escaping, ain't no escaping

Ain't no escaping, ain't no escaping
I tried to escape it, but I hate it
