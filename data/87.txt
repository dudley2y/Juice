Cold
Ain't nothin' but a-
Uh, no good, bad woman, yeah, huh
No good, diamond watchin' woman
Uh
Hey, Rvssian

She ain't nothin' but a no good, diamond watchin' woman
Only love me 'cause she see Versace on my linens
Baby, I'm not God, so your sins are not forgiven
I can never lose, every day I wake up winnin'
Mama told me cut the bad hoes off with the scissors
Make 'em disappear, call me Juice WRLD wizard (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bae, I'm high off narcotics, so your name I cannot remember
Using Opiates overly, openly fuckin' up my image, yeah

One thing you need to know about me is
All I ever wanted was love and money, yeah
One thing you need to know about me is
This rockstar life turned me to a junkie
Another thing you need to know about me is
I'm full of addictions, this is just vindictive
Subject a lil' sensitive, maybe I should just shallow it
Went from talkin' depression to money-makin' prerogative
Still a smart guy, could've got a scholarship
Sayin' fuck college, I'ma tell you how I started it
It took one phone call from G-Money, that's my dawg
Turned me from a twenty dollar nigga to millions in my drawers
This song's about all my talents and vices (Oh-oh)
Listen repeatedly, scream it, recite it (Oh-oh)
Until it piss your father off, he already pissed though (Oh-oh)
I know, 'cause his daughter on my tour givin' deep-throat (Oh-oh)
This song's about all my talents and vices (Oh-oh)
Listen repeatedly, scream it, recite it (Oh-oh)
Your girl give me fellatio, you should be excited (Oh-oh)
'Cause when she come back to you, that's a million dollar night, kiss (Mwah, oh-oh)

She ain't nothin' but a no good, diamond watchin' woman
Only love me 'cause she see Versace on my linens
Baby, I'm not God, so your sins are not forgiven
I can never lose, every day I wake up winnin'
Mama told me cut the bad hoes off with the scissors
Make 'em disappear, call me Juice WRLD wizard (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bae, I'm high off narcotics, so your name I cannot remember
Using Opiates overly, openly fuckin' up my image, yeah

I grew up on all types, I'm talkin' 'bout music and girls, right?
I grew up on all types, I'm talkin' 'bout drugs, the weed and the pills
I grew up on all types, I'm talkin' 'bout music and hoes, right?
And clothes, I was overly exposed
Now I'm bearing the fruits, my mama planted they done growed

Hell yeah, they done glowed up, I done glowed up
Oxycodone got me so'ed up, gotta remain focused
And these groupie hoes bogus, everybody knows it
But they turn me to a poet, with the love commotion
Blood, sweat, and tears, money parted it, Moses
Used to roll mid, now it's gas, what I'm smokin' (What I'm smokin')
Like I farted, hit the gas, I'm in motion (I'm in motion)
Out, departed, wrist hangin' out the window, cost your apartment
This the brightest that my life ever been
I need diamonds all over for when it get dark again
I call my mama up and told her that the devil marchin' in
She sent me Bible verses, then I got distracted by some nudes from a sex worker
Who am I to not text back? That's networking
Who am I to lie about my life? I know the truth hurts
Who am I to say that this ain't one of my best verses?
Uh-oh, too bad it's over (Over)

She ain't nothin' but a no good, diamond watchin' woman
Only love me 'cause she see Versace on my linens
Baby, I'm not God, so your sins are not forgiven
I can never lose, every day I wake up winnin'
Mama told me cut the bad hoes off with the scissors
Make 'em disappear, call me Juice WRLD wizard (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bae, I'm high off narcotics, so your name I cannot remember
Using Opiates overly, openly fuckin' up my image, yeah

I grew up on all types, I'm talkin' 'bout music and girls, right?
I grew up on all types, I'm talkin' 'bout drugs, the weed and the pills
I grew up on all types, I'm talkin' 'bout music and hoes, right?
And clothes, I was overly exposed
Now I'm bearing the fruits, my mama planted they done growed
