Uh
I wanna tell y'all a story about this girl I met
I don't know if it was in person, or if it was in one of my dreams
But she a bigger rockstar than I am
Enviyon on the mix

Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
Racing her to hell
I don't really know her
Would I know her well enough, to know

Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
She gon' die a rockstar
Racing her to hell
I don't really know her
But I know her well enough to know
That she loves to take chances
Posin' in them ripped jeans
Louis V her heels (Louis V her heels)
Hand full of xans
She a rockstar forreal (Rockstar forreal)
I don't really know her
I just know her well enough to know (Enough to know)

I don't really know her well but I know her
All she wanna do is live in the moment
Pick up the pills and mix up the potions
Get high forreal, she not with the posin'
All she ever wanna do is molly in the ocean
I met her in Hollywood and I knew she was poison
She told me take two of these and call her in the morning
I ain't been the same since
I know when you take that road you can't go back home
My heart cold and she know that too
Play your role, and I'll play my games
We could role that dice, but know I won't lose
No I won't lose, you can pick and choose
It don't matter what I do, I just wanna be a rockstar like you

Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
She gon' die a rockstar
Racing her to hell
I don't really know her
But I know her well enough to know
That she loves to take chances
Posin' in them ripped jeans
Louis V her heels (Louis V her heels)
Hand full of xans
She a rockstar forreal (Rockstar forreal)
I don't really know her
I just know her well enough to know (Enough to know)

I don't really know her well, but I know her
