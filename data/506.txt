Need a drink? (Hoo, ayy, ayy)
Found my home (Hoo, ooh, hoo, oh)
She make me leave the pills at home and I'm fine...

Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the pills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it

There's love at my front door, short notice
She not like the sane girls, I noticed
Think I met my soulmate, yeah, I know it
When it gets dark outside, in you I confide
You help me face my demons, I won't hide, hide
Girls like you are hard to find
I hope you don't mind, if I give you the time of your life, life, life

Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the pills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it

I love the streets too much and I be slingin' and bangin'
She heard all about me she know 'bout my reputation
Scared to love me back, she know I'm dangerous and crazy
I just want your heart so I can take it and break it
I just want for you to hold it down for me, baby
I just want for you to stay around when I'm faded
You don't hold me down, who gon' be down?
I be poppin' rhythm, droppin' out
Way I hold you down, I got you drownin', yeah
If you don't stay around, who gon' be 'round, then? Yeah
I don't wanna see you happy if I'm not the reason

Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the pills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold


Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the pills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
