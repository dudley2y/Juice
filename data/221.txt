Hm, hm, hm, hm
Yeah, woke up fresh

Woke up fresh, VVS my chest
Choppa Breaking Bad, just like crystal meth
I'm gon’ take the neck, baby, you can keep the sex
Feel like Terry Crews, baby, yeah, I love to flex
I'ma check a bag like airport security
I need a private jet, no airport security
I fly in with my Tec, airport security
I take off like a jet, airport security, ayy

I'm the coupe man (Skrt)
And I’m coolin' with the Juice man (Ha)
No O. J. pour a deuce inside your soup, man (Deuce)
Eat it up (Skrt, Skrt)
I'm gon' beat it up (Ha)
Lick it up, young nigga a fan he wanna flick it up
I'm real rich, in a Hellcat watch me fishtail (Skrt)
Fish scales (Skrt), got so much water need a white whale (Ha)
Color pills, pull up with that AK let it rip just like a Beyblade (Yeah, oh)
Put the whip in SRT, do the race like lil' Tay-K

Skrt, Lil' Boat, ha
Skrt, ha
Skrt, ha
Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, ha

Woke up fresh, VVS my chest (Lil Boat)
Choppa Breaking Bad, just like crystal meth (Meth)
I'm gon’ take the neck (Neck), baby, you can keep the sex (Sex)
Feel like Terry Crews, baby, yeah, I love to flex (Flex)
I’ma check a bag like airport security (Yeah)

We got lean on deck, all I sip Hi-Tech
Bite down like Mike Vick dog, coming at your neck
You get shot like a sick dog, pop off like a zit dawg
Gucci, Prada, Fendi, spend a couple thou' on my fit dawg
She know I’m up next so she is obsessed
Gucci in my casket, I'm fresh to death
And I don't want no casket, bury me in my wealth
Hmm, run it up by myself, hunnid band hunnid band by myself
Hunnid band hunnid band by myself

New me, old you, act like I don't know you (Skrt, ha)
They pay respect to me just like they owe it (Skrt, ha)
I remember I was so unnoticed (Skrt, ha)
Now everybody wanna photo (Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, ha)
