Past hoes, comin' back in the present (Oh-woah-woah-woah)
Past hoes, comin' back in the present (Yeah)

She wears short skirts, she's a keeper
She don't love me, I don't either (Punk star)
No more drugs, I caught a fever
She don't know me, I don't either
It's been a while since I been this gone
It's been a while since she turned me on
Old hoes, comin' back in the present
Open up like a present
It's been a while since I sang this song
It's been a while since I hit your phone
Past hoes comin' back in the present

She don't love me, she say I'm a loser
How can I lose, when I fucked on my tutor
I told her to hold my Ruger
Cause when twelve comes, she'll be the loser
It's been a while since I've seen your face
It's been a while since I've been this wasted, Hennessy the remedy
Lookin' in the mirror and I'm startin' to see my enemy
It's been a while since I've been this wrong
It's been a while since you've turned me on
Liquor bringin' memories
Tryna fight the devil for some inner peace

She wears short skirts, she's a keeper
She don't love me, I don't either
No more drugs, I caught a fever
She don't know me, I don't either
It's been a while since I been this gone
It's been a while since she turned me on
Old hoes, comin' back in the present
Open up like a present
It's been a while since I sang this song
It's been a while since I hit your phone
Past hoes comin' back in the present
