Pain, whoa
Mello made it right
I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
Yeah

I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga, we got busy, got hit between the eyes
Put my problems in a Backwood and put it in the sky
Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky
I was taught to love my brothers and to hate the other side
Hate the other side, hate the other side

Boujee off the ecstasy, I might act woo
I lost gang members, I can't act cool, uh
I got gang scriptures in my tattoos
I was runnin' from the police in my trap shoes
Posted tryna flip a hundred, I couldn't buy food
Come from nothin' but I blossom to a tycoon
Betrayal scars, can't stop thinkin' 'bout them stab wounds
We might not catch him today but he gon' die soon
I'm from Chicago, she said she like my accent
I'm from Chicago, a Glock's what we react with
Stand him tall, make him tumble when that MAC spit
Bitch, I'm a gangster, I just took off from some rap shit (Off from some rap shit)

I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga, we got busy, got hit between the eyes
Put my problems in a Backwood and put it in the sky
Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky
I was taught to love my brothers and to hate the other side
Hate the other side, hate the other side, ayy
