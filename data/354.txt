I'm just tryna vibe with ya
Ain't ready to leave just yet
Hope you ain't ready to leave just yet
Just yet, mm

Hope you ain't ready to leave just yet, uh
Really tryna vibe with ya
Roll one up and I'll get high with ya
I see the stars, touch the sky with ya, yeah
Me, I'm really insecure
You could blame it on my battle scars, uh
Me, I'm really insecure
You could blame it on my battle scars, uh

Uh, love and passion
I'm on a search for the magic
Tryna drive through life but sometimes I get caught in traffic
Uh, chain reactions
From toxic interactions
Had me feelin' like all women was gon' do me tragic
Uh, now I panic
Suffer emotional damage
Saw you from across the room, I had to look again
Uh, now I panic
Ain't goin' how I planned it
I'm low on confidence even though my wrist is avalanchin'
Uh, can I have this dance?
Be real, do you got a man?
These pills got me in my feels, but still, I'm just wonderin'
If she feels the way I feel and then we in Wonderland
Uh, never met vibes like this
Go n' stay in my life for a bit
Really diggin' your smile, like shit
This comin' from a wild-ass kid
Had to grow up real, real young
Never been on no childish shit
I got into the drugs, I'm lit
Now I'm thinking that I should stop it
Gotta weigh out all my options
You a flame in the land of darkness

Hope you ain't ready to leave just yet, uh
Really tryna vibe with ya
Roll one up and I'll get high with ya
I see the stars, touch the sky with ya, yeah
Me, I'm really insecure
You could blame it on my battle scars, uh
