Drum solo

Stuck  in my ways, stuck in my
Stuck  in my ways, all the time
Stuck in my ways, in my mind
Stuck in my ways, stuck in my
Stuck  in my, stuck in my ways

Only  pay attention to the things that I say
Off the molly got me feeling like a Grade A, Grade A
Percocet  up in the morning it's gon' be a great day
Ha, woof, I'm a big dog I roof
New Audi got no roof
James Bond but I don't wear suits
Fellatio  up in my coupe
You want smoke I'ma call my troops
They kind of like BlocBoy JB, all they do is sh-shoot
Versace on me like Medu-sa
I'ma fuck on the dooze
I pour up a 4 of the ooze
Then put the ''ooze'' in ''Snooze''
Pussy is a door, I'm pushing through it
Her friends, I adore
So I'm gon' fuck 'em too
I'm a Matador, dodge the bullshit
Adamant, atta-boy, I done made it
Lost track of all the pills I've taken, I'm faded
I'm so damn high that I ain't notice shorty getting naked

La-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la (Ooh)
Ooooh

Stuck in my ways, walking through my brain
Me and Wonder, wondering why all these hoes cray
I asked my brother Thugger, he said that these hoes bray (Slatt)
And that I shouldn't even cuff 'em in the first place (Let's go)
It feels like I'm on a plane, allow me to elaborate (Uh)
That means I'm so damn high that heaven feels a touch away (Uh huh)
I gotta slow down on these drugs, ain't tryna die at an early age (Uh uh)
It's kind of hard to do because life's so fucking fast paced

La-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la (Ooh)
Ooooh

Stuck in my ways, stuck in my (Ooh, ooh)
Stuck in my ways, all the time (Ooh, ooh)
Stuck in my ways, in my mind (Ooh, ooh)
Stuck in my ways, stuck in my (Ooh, ooh)
Stuck in my, stuck in my ways (Ooh, ooh)
