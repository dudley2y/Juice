Hello
Uh-huh?
Are you up
Yeah

Sip on four fours, tippin' with a bad ho
Full of shit, ask niggas, I'm an asshole
On the scene with my .40, with my cash flow
Throw a band, she gon' drop the ass low
Told that bitch to ride my dick just like a lasso
I was taught to let live then to let go
I was taught to pull up with the shell toes
I'm in the cut, Shaquille O'Neal, throwin' them elbows, yeah

I be high, man in the mirror
Pop a Xan', pop a Perc', then I disappear
Too much stress up in the room I get outta here
Pull up on the scene, ball like fingerroll
Eyes red they around smoking on that demon ho, gas, ayy
'Rari, I'ma start it, do the dash, ayy
I'ma leave that bitch right in the past

Sip on four fours, tippin' with a bad ho
Full of shit, ask niggas, I'm an asshole
On the scene with my .40, with my cash flow
Throw a band, she gon' drop the ass low
Told that bitch to ride my dick just like a lasso
I was taught to let live then to let go
I was taught to pull up with the shell toes
I'm in the cut, Shaquille O'Neal, throwin' them elbows, yeah
