I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side

Devil on my shoulder telling me I'll die soon
I don't really want that to impact you
But I don't know, maybe I'm just paranoid
I just want the best for you, I just want what's left of you
Oh, you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah, I pray that I'll get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright
Oh, you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah, I pray that I'll get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright

I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side

Between you and me I think that I'm gone die soon
Is cool, I got what's coming to me is cool
Ain't no point running from me is cool
Ain't no escaping, I tried to escape it
But hate it, in my complex in my basement
Interviews with Complex very basic
Shit I hate it
The worst thing I ever did was become famous
Doctors tell me I'll be dead by next June
Unless I stop all these pills I'm in to
I haven't had enough
I want to die beloved

I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
