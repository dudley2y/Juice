Lyrics from Snippet

Am I okay? Am I drowning in...

I'm so sick and tired of being such a liar
Restlessness at it's highest, everything's on fire
Sorry but I'm not the type of person you should admire
Time has come so I guess I'll just retire
Destroying you obviously was not my desire...

I never really cared what you said
Never thought that you'd change
Now I'm left all alone and you're far away
Guess you finally found a way to run away

Am I okay? Am I drowning in pain?
And all this hate is driving me insane
Am I okay? Am I drowning in pain?
And all this hate is driving me insane
