Yeah, I still breathe fast, every time I'm off the xans
I just may pop one, pop two, pop three, if you find another man

Midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight
Told her we gon' have a good time, good time, good time, good time
Yeah, I swear it was midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight
Told her we gon' have a good time, good time, good time, good time

Yeah, it was twelve AM when I first saw you face
I heard you was popping molly and you would be at the rave
You say when I wrap my arms around you, that you feel safe
I think all these xans finna take me up to heaven, feelin' like a better place

I met you at midnight, midnight, boolin' in the club
You looked me in my eyes one time and knew that I was off the drugs

Midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight
Told her we gon' have a good time, good time, good time, good time
Yeah, I swear it was midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight
Told her we gon' have a good time, good time, good time, good time

Yeah, it was twelve AM, this time we in my room
I could see the stars on the ceiling, baby, 'cause we was trippin' off the shrooms
Yeah, you with a real nigga now, so don't worry 'bout the fakes
We eatin' good, we eatin' good, I got diamonds on my plate

I met you at midnight, midnight, boolin' in the club
You looked me in my eyes one time and knew that I was off the drugs

Midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight
Told her we gon' have a good time, good time, good time, good time
Yeah, I swear it was midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight
Told her we gon' have a good time, good time, good time, good time
