Bitch, it's wartime, on the front lines
I'ma die for your love, be all mine
Haven't felt this way in a long time
When you're by my side everything's alright
Fight a good fight, fight a good fight
You're a great girl, I'm a good guy
Only need one chance, only one try
You really make a sad boy have a fun time

You're the definition of a good vibe
You're the definition of a good time
When it's dark out you bring sunshine
Put me in my place when I'm out of line
I met you on Twitter that was online
Fell for you in no time
Now we on our own time
I really love the way that you could stop time
Got me having nightmares, dreaming that you not mine
Now you're in my phone, you're my number one contact
Kind of get depressed when I call and you don't call back
Need you in my life, said need 'cause I mean that
Girl, you're doper than a relapse

Bitch, it's wartime, on the front lines
I'ma die for your love, be all mine
Haven't felt this way in a long time
When you're by my side everything's alright
Fight a good fight, fight a good fight
You're a great girl, I'm a good guy
Only need one chance, only one try
You really make a sad boy have a fun time

You really make a sad boy turn a frown all the way upside down, upside down
You walked into my life and you turned my world upside down, upside down
They say everything happens for a reason, well it's our time now, our time now
No time outs, no time outs
Lay right there, hold on, I'm gon' fuck your brains out
I give you compliments, I won't point your flaws out
Put it all on the line, give my all out
You're the only thing on my mind half of the time
I just wanna drown in your love, bury me alive

Bitch, it's wartime, on the front lines
I'ma die for your love, be all mine
Haven't felt this way in a long time
When you're by my side everything's alright
Fight a good fight, fight a good fight
You're a great girl, I'm a good guy
Only need one chance, only one try
You really make a sad boy have a fun time
