Lyrics from Snippet

Somethin', somethin'
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin' (Bitch)
(DJ Victoriouz with me in the building)
Huh? Yeah, uh

Everyday chasin' the racks (Yeah)
They ask where I'm from, it's the 'Raq (Yeah)
Eighteen, I came upon a sack nigga (Uh-huh)
Everybody wanna pat me on the back (Uh-huh)
Everybody wanna tell me congrats (Uh-huh)
You ain't gotta do all that (Yeah)
You weren't with me in the trap (Yeah)
My wrist a Ferrari, ain't talkin' tarantula
Look at my bank account, shit is gargantuan
I'm not from this planet, I feel like an alien
Your nigga a dummy, he just like a mannequin
I'm fresh to death, bitch, I feel like a mannequin
Havoc come, savages, costin' 
You fuck with my friends, my girl, or my momma
I'm putting a hit on your whole fuckin' family
Both of my wrists on freezer, hard to believe like Black Jesus
I got a choppa that'll send you to Hell like you just slapped Jesus
 ever ask you shit, you ain't nothing but a pile of feces, huh
 Jesus pieces, huh
Just hoes, Reeses' pieces, uh
Haha, I'm a funny ass nigga, ain't I
Cops on the beat, I'ma drive like a pint
 brain, pop out her retainer
If she ever take it out, cum on her retainer
 five-hundred, feelin' like I'm on Ranger
Momma told me "Never talk to strangers"
I look in the mirror and talk to a stranger
I keep my hoes in cages
But I ain't R. Kelly, she told me her cage was amazin'
Life is a book, it's 'cause I get richer every single time that I'm turnin' the pages
Niggas be fakin', shady
Gotta watch them niggas gettin' fucked up by they homies on the daily
Nobody believed I could do it but, baby
 Christopher Ming, now they call me the greatest
Still a rock hard chinchilla dressed in the latest
I'm a mothefuckin' gorilla, I'm on my ape shit
 prayin' I make it
Shit gettin' to it,  drug dealer
Make a fuck nigga see the crossroads, I'ma bone thug
No love, shawty, twelve slugs, stone cold
Lot of  fuckers say I love 'em, I think they Pinocchio
 better than the Louis V on the 
Gun on me, overseas, doper than a coke king
Moncler, Dior, Gucci, , nigga, I'm the...
...
...bitch, 
They don't know I keep an iron, nigga, move and then I'm gon' shoot
 comin' too
I'ma shoot your boyfriend, it's  on you
Police come, I put the gun on you
Pullover, shoot out the black Subaru
 Dolce Gabbana, feel like Piru
Bad bitch wanna fuck, yeah, I really never liked you
I'ma...
...so I'ma shoot him in his face and then that nigga actin' right
Feel like the , I'm getting these drugs and I'm getting her brain, I'ma  her
 basketball handler
, took a shit on her 
I be risking it all every day, I'm a gambler
Fuck on your bitch, her panties I 
Then it's back to the house where my 
In the jungle feelin' like an animal
Skrt skrt, bitch vroom
Fuck that bitch in her room
When I die put me in a tomb
I can get up and move...
