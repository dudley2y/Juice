Oh, ay
Ay, yuh
Ay, ay, uh

Uh, yee
Feel like The Omen
My eyes are rolling
Stuck in the moment
Protection on me, ain't talking Trojan
Pull up, blowing
Walk around London
100k pound on my clothing
I'm runnin' the town and they know it
Smokin' on loud and I'm zoning
Smoke out the pound, yee-haw
Yo' hoe hold my hoe down, yee-haw
Yo' girl tried to rob my mans
So my bitch shot her down, yee-haw
Up and down off the percs like a see-saw
Like the way these niggas get mad that I'm stuck in my ways
So I'm calling it see-saw
I don't fuck with no parties but I turn my room to a rave
Molly what we on
I don't bother to learn none of these niggas names
Cause to me they all peons
I know one when I see one
Shit, I would hate to be one
It's funny how niggas be hiding in blankets
Like it wasn't me they would sleep on
The alarm clock ring, my theme song, yeah
I was, but I can't be broke, yeah
If I go broke, shooting from Rio, yeah
A Sagittarius but drip like Aquarius
And I be roaring like Leo, yeah
Again, I'ma marry her
Money, I bury it
Life just got a little scarier, yeah
Aim for the neck like a Terrier, yeah
I stack that Franklin Umbury it, Uh-huh

Blood, sweat, tears
With some rough years
Now I'm the overseer
Shittin' on all my peers
Got the wood like a lumberjack, no beard
Run up on me 30 shots to the rear
High as a bitch, is it hot in here
Too high to drive, I let they steer

Fuck with the team, we gon' shoot like LeBron
The original 23. Glock, Cavalier
Got a mask on my face, with a beam on my side
Like I'm at Comic-Con with a Light Saber, yeah
Gun with the sluggs, diamonds on the grills
Pills got me sweating like I'm climbing up a hill
My drip getting wetter so her pussy gettin' wetter
So my dick feel better in it just like an Eel


Blood, sweat, tears
With some rough years
Now I'm the overseer
Shittin' on all my peers
Got the wood like a lumberjack, no beard
Run up on me 30 shots to the rear
High as a bitch, is it hot in here
Too high to drive, I let they steer
