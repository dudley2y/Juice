Inside your world

Demon girl, why’d you trap me inside your world?
I feel like a dream and going around the swirls
Do you know what drives me crazy?
Fucking girls!

Hold up
Talking bout a lifeline
Suicide
I wanna die
Give me time to catch my breath, catch my step
Give me time to catch my breath, catch my step
Now i know everything was imperfect
But babygirl yea, u was worth it
Everything is just coming too fast
I am the flash yea
Keep it low key
Everything inside my stash yea

Don’t catch the regard
Because i’ve getting closer to the motherfucking star
