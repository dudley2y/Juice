Oh my, oh my, oh my, haha
Oh my, oh my (Woah)
Oh my, oh my (Yeah)
Hey, Derzy did it

Now it's back to my old flow
Niggas talkin' that shit 'til I cock a .44
Damn right I keep a shorty, that's a snub nose
Have the Glock sneezin' like it got a bad cold
Woah, and that's word from the realest
Niggas talkin' stupid but they know I'm the trillest
Run up on a nigga, boy, I turn to the trillest
Got the burner in my hand and I ain't afraid to pull it
Woah, woah, real shit on the mic
Talkin' that shit, then I'm comin' for your life
Prolly kill you, then put my dick in your wife
I might fuck on her once, then I fuck on her twice
Real nigga speakin', that mean "Shut the fuck up"
Four leaf clover on my Glock, got it lucked up
Niggas wanna take my life, so it's tucked up
Let a nigga try me, I let that MAC bust (For real)
Real shit, I drill shit, I kill shit
I pop pills 'til I don't feel shit, I'm in my prime

Oh my, oh my, oh my, haha
You know how that go (Ayy)
You know how that go (You know how that go)
You know how that go

Back on it, still goin' too real
Did I mention that I just popped two pills?
With your bad bitch, tryna fuck, gettin' cheap thrills
In the kitchen whippin', I got white meals
I'm tryna get a million, my wrist on a trillion
I blend in with the money like chameleons
All talkin' stupid 'til I come through with Smith &'s
Stevie Wonder, 'cause these niggas can't see shit
Woah, bad vision, I'm in the cut, and I am with precision
And all this shit that you doin', boy, I been did it
Man, free my nigga Scooby he was verdicted
And you know he still servin' on that jail sentence
We gon' get him out
And if a nigga try us, we gon' pick him off
And all these niggas like flies, I'ma get 'em off
And I been goin' super hard, niggas cotton soft (Damn)
I'm the master of this rap shit for real (Yeah)
Master of this rap shit for real
You're my slave 'cause I'm the master of this rap shit for real (Yeah, yeah)

Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)

Yeah, that's the third verse
Freestyle, fuck around no rehearse
Lil Wayne with the bars, I ain't talkin' Rebirth
I'm outerspace getting high, I don't touch earth
Let a nigga try me, I run up on 'em
Put the gun up on 'em, that heat up on 'em
Like sins up on 'em, they don't want no problems
I told you that I'm a goblin
Okay, you're a goon, what's a goon to a God?
I ain't modest, bitch, I am confident
Fuck you, this is common sense
9/11 from the way I'm bombin' shit (For real)
Old school with the flow that'll fuck you up (Yeah)
I'm the man, motherfucker, they like "What the fuck?"
JuiceTheKidd on these beats, abusin'
I am never losin', I catch 'em snoozin'
Your bitch on my dick, yeah, I caught her choosin'
Beat the pussy up, got the kitty bruisin'
Goddamn (haha)

She like the way I spazz on there (Oh my, oh my, oh my)
All these opps, they mad (Ha)
They hate they way I blast on they ass (Oh my, oh my, oh my)
Yeah, yeah (Oh my, oh my, oh my)
Yeah
I got my niggas Joyner and Freddy with me, man
We all mixin' this shit, we doin' it
