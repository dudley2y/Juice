Hit-boy
Uh
G. Ry 

This a death race for love
Love-lookin', gotta keep my eyes closed
How I'm 'sposed to drive with my eyes closed?
This is a death race for love

I grabbed the wheel, crashed into another one
I love another one
Shawty just like my watch, one-of-one
Can't find another one
She really got my heart, no fuckin' up
We be gettin' fucked up
Ridin' round, don't you put those tits down
Oh, yeah, uh, everyday, went for a spin
'Til I seen you in his Benz
I guess my GTR ain't shit
I told you that I want you back
Told me I gotta prove it
Want us to race for ya
Drift off the side of a cliff (Skrrt)
Remember when we would go out for a spin?
One day I saw you in his Benz
Told you I wanted you back, told me to prove it
So here I am on this cliff playin' Tokyo Drift
Whoever doesn't win this race has to die in the end

This a death race for love
Love-lookin' at me, got my eyes closed
How I'm 'sposed to drive with my eyes closed?
This a death race for love
This a death race for love
Love-lookin' at me, got my eyes closed
How I'm 'sposed to drive with my eyes closed?
This a death race for love
