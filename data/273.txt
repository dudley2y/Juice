Cardo got wings
(Yeah)

Wouldn't have it any other way (Yeah)
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take the sufferin' away
Rob your connection, he bufferin', ayy
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day

Take one Perc' 3-0 to the face, ooh, ooh
Scratch my problems away
Callin' up the gang, is it a problem today?
They don't catch feelings, but they'll catch them a case
Took your bitch in Cali, you take Ls in LA
I just want the Rollie with the diamonds in the face
Glizzy in the Goyard, yeah, it ain't on my waist
Wear it around my neck so I look pretty when I spray
I put codeine down, G Money gang still pourin' up
If I tell him you a problem, he gon' fuck you up
He told me nothin' gettin' between us and these fuckin' bucks
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
So much cash we gon' need a dump truck, yeah, ayy

Say he wanna kill me, lil nigga wassup? Uh, I said

Wouldn't have it any other way (Yeah)
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take the sufferin' away
Rob your connection, he bufferin', ayy
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day

You would probably kill me if you had the chance, huh
Probably 'cause I spent a couple thou on pants, huh
Probably 'cause I got your bitch to dirty dance, huh
Fuck her then I'll leave her, call me Dirty Dan, huh
She scratch her head like she got dandruff
You is my son like my name Sanford
Hatin' niggas turn me into Bruce Banner
I ain't Megaman but I got two cannons
Keep a few cannons
Soundin' like a drumline, nigga, Nick Cannon
Said she had a fun time, cocaine dancin'
She wanna go to hell tonight, Marilyn Manson
Marilyn Monroe, I fuck on a white ho

Wouldn't have it any other way (Yeah)
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take the sufferin' away
Rob your connection, he bufferin', ayy
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day
