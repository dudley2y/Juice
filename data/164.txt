Yeah, yeah
Nah, huh

I'm in your crib every day, what's brackin'?
I fuck your bitch every day, what's brackin'?
Came in the club with a K, what's brackin'?
Niggas know I put the K in crackin'
Look at my money, it's everlastin'
Me and my niggas, we young and wildin'
Y'all talkin' tough, you ain't on nothing
My niggas silent and really violent
I ain't go to school or graduate college
But I got a car and it got good mileage
And I got a house, big-ass mansion
Something for all the lil' thots to dance in
Remember scrapin' the pot, yeah
How could I forget 'bout the pot? Yeah
I had rocks in my socks, yeah
Remember, I was servin' your pops, yeah

R.I.P. to my pops, yeah
Even though he ain't do much, uh
Guess I still miss him a lot, yeah
So I got our memories tucked away
R.I.P. to my opps, yeah
Was pissing on graves the other day
If they catch me, they won't hesitate
So I got my hand on my nine today, uh (Ayy)
I up it, I bust it, it ain't no discussion
I make a nigga hyperventilate
I fuck on this thot, ain't no cuddle, she bust it open
Then I'm bustin' all over her face
These groupie bitches, they be scandalous
So with a rubber, I'ma penetrate
I took his bitty on a dinner date
But not for really, I just fucked her face
I keep a few milli' stashed away
Water diamonds like a castaway
Triple 9, nigga, that's the wave
I be on the grind workin' every day
I gotta make sure that my paper straight
Don't got a gun, you get hit with the razor blade
Shoot for the stars, I've been throwin' up fadeaways
Strap with the drum, it make 'em fade away
Heavily armed, shoot, make 'em levitate
I'm not the one, pussy, don't play with me
Chains on my arms, this is not slavery
Diamonds and charms, my wrists on super freeze
Feel like LeBron, I just been scorin'
On everyone, worldwide tourin', life is fun
Niggas love to hate, got me a gun
Send him up to heaven, holes in his lung

I'm in your crib every day, what's brackin'?

Millions on millions, I manage (Manage)

I took your bitch on a yacht, slam it (I)
Then I get in the pot, whip up salmon (Fire)
If I catch an opp with the Glock, hold him ransom (Opp)
Advance him, go cop a mansion (Mansion)
