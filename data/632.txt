Lyrics from snippet

 matress
I try keep it as positive as possible
It be hard when your back's against the wall and the demons on your phone interrupting all your calls
It be hard when your back's against the wall and the demons on your phone interrupting all your calls

AP tick-tock
Foreign, in the garage, cost a hundred
If you don't shut the fuck up, I'll let my Glock talk
They  then break 'em
I just sprinkle on 'em a little hot sauce
2019 my year, year, year, best believe
I drink so much this year, aren't I the greatest you've ever seen do it
Gucci on my rain coat (?)
I ain't (?)
