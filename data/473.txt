Hmm, freestyle
I'm 'bout to let loose, wind me up
Heard he a snitch nigga, tie 'em up
I'll leave him washed up, then dry 'em up
Where my chopper at? Line 'em up
I don't play at all, keep a stick like analog
I don't play at all, keep a stick like analog
I don't play at all, keep a stick like analog
Keep a stick like analog, keep a stick like analog

Collar 'round my neck yeah, I'm a dog yeah
Pig out on a bitch, feelin' like a hog yeah
Count the money up, make sure that it's all there
Use your glasses, contacts, see it all clear
I-I-I've been smokin' chronic you can smell it in the air
You in another country you still smell it over there
You smokin' mid, like a little kid, get that outta here
Bitch I'm rich, I just bought a zip to throw it in the air
Hella bands runnin' like a Lambo' at a red light
Tried to leave me left, so I had to leave you dead right
That's your big homie, why he tellin' to the feds
I've never seen no shit like that in my life
If you ever fuck with my money you gettin' shot up in the head right
Tony Montana (Dead right, dead right)
Kidnap your family (How dare I?)

I don't play at all, keep a stick like analog
I don't play at all, keep a stick like analog
I don't play at all, keep a stick like analog
Keep a stick like analog, keep a stick like analog
