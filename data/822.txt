Tell me why I'm waiting
For someone
Who couldn’t give a fuck about me?
Tired of fuckin waiting
Tired of having patients
Lately I've been feeling like a patient
Tired of being hated
Center of the conversation
Negative thoughts
Over wealming
Well, at least I tried
Done swallowed my pride
My fuckin idol died
I dont know what to say
Wish I could tell you
Why I feel this way
Sadly I'ma fuckin pussy
I ain’t gonna lie
Lately I've been feeling a lil fuzzy
Like no body trust me
Like nobody care at all
I already feel like I lost it all
I been in my fuckin head
Like every single day
And I'm just off the rum cuz I can't fuckin cope it's insane
No one Fuckin cares
I cannot be saved
Demon or angel
Same shit either way
So tell me
Why the fuck I'm waiting
For some bullshit
40 Glock shells
Butch I'm plotting
Grab the fuckin shotgun
Shell in my skull and I don't give a fuck
Face hit the pavement Im dead and they struck
Demons they haunt me I’ll never succom
To the maddness the saddness I feel like I’m scum
