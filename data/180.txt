Baby where you at
We can play these games, if you wanna

We can play these games if you wanna
And you can say my name if you wanna
We can take it there (Huh)
You can be my main, if you wanna
Or you could give me brain, if you wanna

Hey, my mama told me never play with karma
The only thing I'm lovin' is the drama, I'm not playing fair
Hey, I'm playin' love games 'cause I wanna
And even if I lose, I'ma lace up and play again
Lace up and play again
And even if I lose, I'ma lace up and play again
La-lace up and play again
And even if I lose, I'ma lace up and play again

Just to even out, just to even out
Now that we got that out the way
Girl, what you about?
Time passes, chillin' with a few hoes
One is on my lap, it was three in my two-door
They know me too well, showin' all my loopholes
Now I gotta move to some hoes from the west coast
All they wanna do is coke, give 'em red nose
Now I got 'em on the leash, I'm like, "Let's go"
All they wanna do is coke, give 'em red nose
Now I got 'em on the leash, I'm the dog 'doe
Crash, all this broken glass, I feel like a vandal
Smash! When I do the dash, I'ma crash the Lambo'
Love how it never lasts, love is like a scandal
Yeah, my love is like a scandal (Huh)

We can play these games if you wanna
And you can say my name if you wanna
We can take it there (Huh)
You can be my main, if you wanna
Or you could give me brain, if you wanna

Get up in her head, and see what she made of
Go cry to your man, but he can't save ya
Go and tell him that another nigga played ya
I can see the tears all in your face
Knowing damn well, you can't run away
You can't run away
Knowing damn well you can't run away
