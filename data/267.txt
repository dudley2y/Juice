I might fall in, it's four AM
Looked her dead in her soul and I was like

Okay, it's four AM (Okay)
I might fall in (Okay)
But she not by my side, her I stay calling (Okay)
Pussy good, got me hooked, I'm her drug addict (Uh)
Fell in love with her like my new Patek (Uh)
Tell me what is love, I ain't good at it
But she the type to make a nigga take a crack at it (Uh)
Girl, give me my fix, crack addict
I said, "Bitch, give me my fix, I'm a crack addict" (Ooh)

Okay bae, excuse my French (Uh)
You not no bitch, but you my bitch, just how it is (Uh)
A bad bitch at that
Run my tongue down your hips (Uh), give the kitty a kiss (Uh)
Pussy is power and (Um), you're powerful as shit, love (Um)
I fuck her with my eyes closed, then I feel her
I open up my eyes, woah, overwhelmingly close
Don't keep them legs closed, let me in, love
You are my drug, and I'm tryna catch a overdose
Can you feel it? 'Cause I know damn well I can feel it (For real)
You can ride me, pop you a wheelie (On God)
I mean you did say you was from Philly, right? (You did)
You do got me in my feelings, right (You do)
You always have me feeling right (You do)
You mixing my dick with liquor, right? (Uh)
You love it when I lick it, right? (Uh)
Your parents got that white people money
You know that I'm a nigga, right? (I am)
You know that I'm that nigga, right? (I am)
Not afraid to pull that trigger, right (I'm not)
I pull you like a trigger, right (Yeah)
My shovel out I dig her, right (Yeah)
Fantasize putting my dick in her mouth every time we fight

Okay, it's four AM (Okay)
I might fall in (Okay)
But she not by my side, her I stay calling (Okay)
Pussy good, got me hooked, I'm her drug addict (Uh)
Fell in love with her like my new Patek (Uh)

Girl, give me my fix, crack addict
I said, "Bitch, give me my fix, I'm a crack addict" (Ooh)

A fear of falling in love, but you make it easy for me
A spear right through your heart, signed by Cupid and yours truly
We want no smoke, I'ma pill pop, fuck a doobie
Phone out when we make love, makin' movies
I go back and watch 'em every time you're not near me
Record us on a new iPhone so I can see it clearly
You having a twin is the only way that I'm cheating
L.O.L, I'm joking, let me stop playin' before you kill me
No syrup, no pills, no smoke, that's the real me
Off two percs, look like I'm shooting dope up, you feel me?
I say that to say that you give me the same feeling
Momma said you good for me, get a thumbs up from my family
I pray that, I pray that we have a happy ending
Holy matrimony, even though we always sinning (Amen)

Okay, it's four AM (Okay)
I might fall in (Okay)
But she not by my side, her I stay calling (Okay)
Pussy good, got me hooked, I'm her drug addict (Uh)
