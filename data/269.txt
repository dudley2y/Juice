I don't wanna rush
But I already rushed it, so fuck it
I know that it’s love
But I'm also lust, and I love it (Yeah)
I don't wanna rush
But I already rushed it, so fuck it
I know that it’s love
But I'm also lust, and I love it

Kinda fucked up how we fuckin'
You gettin' choked out, and you love it
We too busy focused on depression
Damn, I can't really focus under pressure
Damn, I ain't know that you were such a druggie
It's ironic cause you're the one that’s addicting
It’s ironic cause you're the piece that I’m missing
And you say that I'm the piece that make ends meet
Damn, still get' no peace, still get no sleep
Every time you work for me, promise you won't play with me
They told me to stay away, I told you to stay with me
Pack your bags, pretty ass, come live in LA with me

I don’t wanna rush
But I already rushed it, so fuck it
I know that it's love
But I'm also lust, and I love it (Yeah)
I don't wanna rush
But I already rushed it, so fuck it
I know that it's love
But I'm also lust, and I love it

I know how you feel
I've been through it too bae
But I want this for real, for real
I don't want a new bae
It's just me and you bae
I'm thinkin' 'bout you bae
While I'm in the stu', bae
If a nigga try it, you know I'm gon' shoot bae
He gon' end up dyin'
He fuckin' with you bae
Maybe I was lyin'
When I said it was just you
Maybe I got a few bae
Or maybe it's just you, bae
But don't get it confused, bae
I love you bae, I love you bae, I love you bae

I don't wanna rush
But I already rushed it, so fuck it
I know that it's love
But I'm also lust, and I love it (Yeah)
I don't wanna rush
But I already rushed it, so fuck it
I know that it's love
But I'm also lust, and I love it
