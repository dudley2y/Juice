Enviyon on the mix

I run up in yo' trap, leave you hogtied
It's hard to whip a Rolls with the doors wide
We don't do indoors, bitch, we outside
With a half a brick and a four-five
Give me one more Xanny, I'ma flat line
I'ma count this green in the meantime
Rolling off a bean, bitch, I feel fine (Bitch, I feel fine)
Rocking my Supreme with my Glock 9

I got the sack and I'm never gon' fumble
I grew up and struggled and came from the jungle
And he wanna fight but I ain't come to tussle
I roll with them niggas that shoot at your tummy, like woah (Woah)
Flexing, I don't move a muscle
I'm shooting like Kobe, I'm dunking like Russell
And bitch, I be balling like O.K.C. Thunder
I fucked her in Paris but she came from London, like woah (Woah)
I put my dick in her stomach
I fuck her one time then I pass to my brothers
And I rock Givenchy, that come out the country
And I fuck that coochie until she start cummin', like woah (Woah)
Bitch, I don't walk it, I run it
I am the shit, nigga, no toilet plunger
Whipping my wrist, tryna make me a million
And bitch, I don't talk it if I do not live it

Like woah (Woah), damn
I did it all on my own, damn
Ain't talkin' money then leave me alone, damn (Yeah)
Like Roger go home, damn, yeah, yeah

Go home, Roger (Go home, Roger)
