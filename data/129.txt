Yeah, uhm
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh

She want a title, I'm in denial
Don't need a rifle, everyone suicidal
I'ma burn a bridge, I feel like a pyro
I'ma say my prayers, I'll be hellbound tomorrow
I'm in my sorrow, oxy-my-codone
Does someone have a heart that I could borrow?
Tearing me apart
Does someone have a heart that I could borrow?
Borrow, oh

Time after time, they let me drown in my sorrow
I run through the night, I only wish for tomorrow
Love, love, love, got me walkin' in circles
Something isn't right
I'm livin' a lie, uh
Ain't no you and I
Walking in circles
Something isn't right

And I'm in denial
I don't need a rifle, everyone's suicidal
I'ma burn a bridge, feel like a pyro
I'ma say my prayers, I'll be hellbound tomorrow
I'm in my sorrow, oxy-my-codone
Does someone have a heart that I could borrow?
Tearing me apart
Does someone have a heart that I could borrow?
Borrow, borrow

It's crazy how I feel, right?
I wonder if this real life
Will I see tomorrow, tomorrow?
