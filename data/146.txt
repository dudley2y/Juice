Rock-star status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, get 'em up
Rock-star status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, run 'em up

No more Xannies, gave em up
Last time I xannied, I threw up
In her panties, tear it up
She love all my Givenchy, she wear it up
She still running, from my love
Got the demons on me, I'm below high
And I'm done running, from the drugs
But they still running, from my gun, right
Club life, drug life, saw her in the club light
She a killer in the white shirt, that shit Off-White
How you finna ball on my turf? That shit off-sides
She told me that if I took the right drugs, then I won't die

Rock-star status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, get em up
Rock-star status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, run em up

I get money in my lone time, on my own time
I just popped a perc, and called a play so I'll be fine
Don't believe in sunshine, I'm a night guy
I lied when I told her I was Mr. Nice guy
Rock-star status, in the cut, with some Molly missin'
And you know that they dirty dancin' for the dope
She said she gon' suck me up until the bitch choke
Bitch, I'm Danny Phantom, with the ghost
Pull up in a Phantom, like a ghost, right
Young rich, handsome, did the most, huh
Pop it like Champagne, she tryna have a toast, right

Rock-star status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, get 'em up
Rock-star status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, (CHASETHEMONEY, CHASETHEMONEY), dummy, run 'em up
