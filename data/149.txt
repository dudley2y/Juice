Oh-oh, oh
Oh

Met her in the summer, led to the fall of me
Yeah, it's such a bummer
I gave the bitch all of me
Met her in the summer, it led to the fall of me
And it's such a bummer
'Cause I gave the bitch all of me

I gave her my all, yeah, yeah
I showed her my flaws, yeah, yeah
Round of applause, you got me
But I still won, because you topped me in your back seat (Yeah)
In an all black Cavalier, don't you remember, that December?
Admit, lil' bitch don't be scared
Don't you remember? You were my little sinner, yeah

Met her in the summer (Met her in the summer), led to the fall of me (Led to the fall of me)
Yeah, it's such a bummer (Such a bummer)
I gave the bitch all of me (I gave her all of me)
Met her in the summer (In the summer), it led to the fall of me (Led to the fall of me)
And it's such a bummer (Such a bummer)
'Cause I gave the bitch all of me (I gave her all of me)

I gave her all of me, physically, spiritually, oh
Fake spiritual ho
I gave her all of me, mentally leavin' me cold
Takin' love from my soul

Love, respect, in that order, I gave her all of me
Even walked across the water, I gave her all of me
Hoppin' fences, crossin' borders, I gave her all of me
Literally all, all of me

Met her in the summer (Met her in the summer), led to the fall of me (Led to the fall of me)
Yeah, it's such a bummer (Such a bummer)
I gave the bitch all of me (I gave her all of me)
Met her in the summer (In the summer), it led to the fall of me (Led to the fall of me)
And it's such a bummer (Such a bummer)
Cause I gave the bitch all of me (I gave her all of me)

I gave her all of me, physically, spiritually, oh
Fake spiritual ho
I gave her all of me, mentally leavin' me cold
Takin' love from my soul
