Admire me and inspire me
I do the same thing for you, that's the irony
All these arguments are starting to get trifling
Tear drops, we smoke we gone need some Visine

Uh, lemme hit it, hit it
I remember the first time you let me hit it, hit it
I remember the first time we was kissin', kissin'
If you leave I miss it
Baby let's be realistic and a little optimistic
Tell me that you dying wit me
And that you ridin' wit me
You know I ride wit semi's
I'll give a fuck nigga plenty
Really, really, really, really
Flexin' and fuckin'
That shit be silly
Know I ride you like a wheely
Uh, really, really, really, really
Tell me are you fuckin' wit me
Or are you just fuckin' kidding
Fuck ups, yeah I had too many
Still deserve a happy ending
All those drugs that I was taking
Almost had an early ending
All that shit that he was talking
Almost had an early ending
Back on point
Kiss my neck while I roll this joint
Moan real loud let me hear your voice
Together forever, won't have no choice
But I wouldn't trust me wit your soul
That shit fuck around and get sold
I went platinum with out trying
Niggas be bustin' they ass for gold

Admire me and inspire me
I do the same thing for you, that's the irony
All these arguments are starting to get trifling
Tear drops, we smoke we gone need some Visine
