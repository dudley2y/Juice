Back at the motel, had a hell of a night
I'm in the sky like an eagle, eagle
Even though a nigga pelican fly
I remember they was doubtin' us
They ain't know I had my eyes on the prize
In the studio, sippin' codeine all night
Caught a fuck-nigga slipping, I put him on ice
Shoot the brain out his head and then I leave him to die
I just gave his mom a reason to cry
I'm a real ass nigga, don't believe in the lies
Please don't look me in my eyes
'Cause you could see the pain inside, leave a nigga terrified
