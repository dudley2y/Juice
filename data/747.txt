Uh yeah we on the 999 shit right?
This got me rolling *laughs* like loud
Get it? Haha watch this though

Now there is no time
No time to rewind
Let's go to the past (Huh)
Let's go rewind
Drugs are giving me a blur
Now I'm in the state line
I don't know but is it her? (Woah)
Now there is no time
No time to rewind
Let's go to the past (Huh)
Let's go rewind
Drugs are giving me a blur
I don't know but is it her? (Woah)

Now this is first shout out Patrick Automatic (Yeah)
Like the bro be causing havoc don't care bout no static (Huh)
Sorry that it happened but trust me you will go past it (Huh)
There's no real ones
Always switching for no one
Now that we see what happened (Huh)
The people will let you back in
My mind is just going wack and
Like the Flintstones I'm going whacking (Pow)
Now let’s talk about the past with her
All the times that we believed in her
Should've talked it out but you was fiending her (Ah)
Now we realize who put us in a blur
Now it's time to bring you back to earth
Don't forget about the times I tried to comment her
Actually about the time I tried to show your worth
Now these drugs are taking me all out the earth
I love you man just know that it’s your time to work

Now there is no time
No time to rewind
Let's go to the past (Huh)
Let's go rewind
Drugs are giving me a blur
Now I'm in the state line
I don't know but is it her? (Woah)
Now there is no time
No time to rewind
Let's go to the past (Huh)
Let's go rewind
Drugs are giving me a blur
I don't know but is it her? (Woah)
