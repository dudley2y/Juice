You got what I need
Straight pill pop, don't smoke weed
Pussy and pill pop
Uh-huh, yeah, uh

Baby you got what I need
You pussy and pill pop, don't smoke weed
Give me top in the 'Rari backseat
Uh, feelings I caught like a taxi
Now you hittin' my phone, mad at me
'Cause I'm chillin' with my bros, sippin' on cough syrup
Cheatin' on the low, yeah I know it's absurd
Gettin' to the dough, I count it up faster

Told her I don't got shit for a ho
In the studio I'm trappin' hard (Yeah), hunnid a brick it's not for the low (Uh-huh)
I told that bitch to play her part if she smart she a hold (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
All the drugs, all the poles
And take my case for me po-po
In exchange for that I'll give her coke
Yeah I know she in love with the coco (Yeah)
Do lines off my dick take a photo
Verizon I got connections, ho
My time is especially special, ho
In the VIP section with Louis on
Looking for an extra ho
It's just in case my main ho leave the other one gon' be down to go
Scratch 'em off the list, huh, in the crack she hold my brick
I fell in love with one of 'em, the worst mistake I could've did
The police come, she swallow the drugs the same way that she swallow my kids
And the look in her eyes reminds me of my wrist

It remind me of my wrist (It reminds)
It reminds me of my wrist
The look in her eyes remind me of my wrist (It reminds)
It reminds me of my wrist (Reminds, reminds, reminds)
Ya dig?

Baby you got what I need
You pussy and pill pop, don't smoke weed

Now you hittin' my phone, mad at me
'Cause I'm chillin' with my bros, sippin' on cough syrup
