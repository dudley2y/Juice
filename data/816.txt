Sorry, I'm richer than a bitch, bitch, bitch, white bitch (Um)
Hello?
Uh-huh?
Are you up?
Yeah

Sip on four fours, tippin' with a bad ho
Full of shit, ask niggas, I'm an asshole
On the scene with my .40, with my cash flow (Tch)
Throw a band, she gon' drop that ass low
Told that bitch to ride my dick just like a lasso
I was taught to let live then to let go (Huh)
I was taught to pull up with the shell toes
I'm in the cut, Shaquille O'Neal, throwin' them elbows, yeah

I be high, man in the mirror
Pop a Xan', pop a Perc', then I disappear
Too much stress up in the room, I get outta here (Hello, are you up?)
Pull up on the scene, ball like fingerroll
Eyеs red year-round, smoking on that demon, ho
Gas (Uh, ayy)
'Rari, I'ma start it, do thе dash (Uh, ayy)
I'ma leave that bitch right in the past

Or you mad 'cause I only love my mom
And these hunnids buy drugs, then I'm back gettin' money with my cousins
