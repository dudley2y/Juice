Yeah
This one for all the people that believe in me
We gon' make it there

You still at the bottom
I’m still at the bottom, I'm not goin' anywhere
I’m chasin' the stardom, might happen tomorrow
Just hold on, I know we gon' make it there
We could look in the past and just drop it
But if you gon' keep it, I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game, well if that is the case
Then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom, I'm not goin’ anywhere
I’m chasin' the stardom, might happen tomorrow
Just hold on, I know we gon’ make it there

Fuck everybody, they hate me
Hold hands and jump off of that fucking cliff
I’ma start off by answering unanswered questions
The answer is no, you can't fuck with this
(No, you can't fuck with this) But you don't have to
Let's cut to the chase, I'ma God of a rapper (A mother fuckin' God)
And when I say "cut to the chase"
I mean runoff and hope I don't stab you
Hope I don't have to fuckin' attack you
Spittin' more ink than a motherfuckin' tattoo
Bitch, I'm not bashful
Bitch, I will bash you
You just a sack to my tackle
I'm just a rapper with wrappin's
Wrappin' this rap up in raps
So I guess I'm just wrappin' it up
Life is a drug, so I trip like a Klutz
To the point where I'm really not giving a fuck
I think that I'm crazy
Fuck it, I know that I lost it
Ain't using my brain, so I might as well toss it
If you don't like me, then jump in a coffin, I bet you're exhausted
Poke out your eyes, so you can't see me flossin'
And cut off your tongue, so I can't hear you talkin'
Cut off your ears, so you can't hear me yappin'
I ain't mean to wake yo ass up with my rappin'

You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom, I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm chasin' the stardom, might happen tomorrow
Just hold on, I know we gon' make it there
We could look in the past and just drop it
But if you gon' keep it, I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game, well if that is the case
Then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair

I'm up with the rockets
I'm so outta pocket
I take off, I'm out of this atmosphere
I'm so out of this world
I'm so out of my mind
I'm so out of my place
I'm so out of here
Please get out of my way before I go insane
And then put yo ass out of your misery
All these niggas say that I'm so out of it
Well, I guess I don't know what's gotten into me
I'm just cruisin' and coolin', I vibe to survive and I hope you pick up on my energy
Catch his ass while he snoozin', that's straight homicide if you ever try takin' some shit to me
Swear the girl is the love of my life, is it cheating if I say that life is a bitch to me?
Am I mean if I tell you to go straight to hell, and that you niggas do not mean shit to me?

You still at the bottom

Not gon' be playing fair
Not gon' be playing fair

I'm just not gon' be playing fair
They say life is a game
Well, if that is the case, then I guess I'm just not gone be playing fair
