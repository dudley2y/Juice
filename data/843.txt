Lyrics from Snippet

Spend it, yee-haw
I'ma spend it
Cha-ching, cha-chow
What

I spend it all, I spend it all
Her time involved, I spend it all
Up early morning, ain't no sleep at all
Ain't no sleep involved, I just spend it all

Told her how I feel, now I send her off
This ain't 
Ups and downs off the percs, that's a seesaw
I told her howdy come around and she said yee-haw
Bitch I'm in  (Cha-ching)
When I throw money on the horse (Cha-ching)
Everyday I give to the dough (Cha-ching)
Who makes the world go around (Cha-ching)
Who makes the girls go down (Cha-ching)
Spent like a merry-go-round (Yeah)
I count to a bigger amount (Yeah)
My pockets so deep that I can fish in that bitch and If I jump in that bitch I'ma drown (Yeah)
Me and Zaytoven just made a sound (Yeah)
Me and Zaytoven just made a wave (Yeah)
I can throw it in a fuck nigga's face (Yeah)
I don't give a fuck what a fuck nigga says
