All through the midnight hours
Running from my fears, shit I feel like a coward
Kryptonite killed all of my superpowers
My anxiety builds, I jump off the stress tower
Reaching for the pills, I take Opiate showers
Growing from my sins that I'm planting in flowers
Devil got me snorting lines of enchantment powder
Life is a bitch and her lips taste sour

I find it fascinating that I'm high off my own supply
Buckle up it's gon' be a long ride
Knuckle up, these demons came to fight (Oh)
Run 'em up, up, up, cause a ruckus (Oh)
Had enough, 'nough, 'nough, screaming fuck this (Oh)
Yeah, fuck this all
Life gets dirty, time for the Lysol
Making crucial mistakes, yeah I know it's my fault
You hate to look at my face, yeah I know it's my fault
You don't gotta tell me, I know I'm the cause
Surgery is needed put away the gauze

All through the midnight hours
Running from my fears, shit I feel like a coward
Kryptonite killed all of my superpowers
My anxiety builds, I jump off the stress tower
Reaching for the pills, I take Opiate showers
Growing from my sins that I'm planting in flowers
Devil got me snorting lines of enchantment powder
Life is a bitch and her lips taste sour

Sometimes life flies over my head, yeah
It's out of my hands, yeah, hard to comprehend that
I thought of money, you still got on calling it quits
Went out the misery business, cause I can't take it
Things ain't what they seem, they think it's easy to be me
I never let them see me bleed, I only let them see peace
Things ain't what they seem, they think it's easy to be me
I never let them see me bleed, nor see me in pieces
I'm getting used to opening up to people around me
I know that they're my family, they would do anything to help me
But they still don't know everything that is going on inside of me
Even I don't know all the places my demons are hiding

All through the midnight hours
Running from my fears, shit I feel like a coward
Kryptonite killed all of my superpowers
My anxiety builds, I jump off the stress tower
Reaching for the pills, I take Opiate showers
Growing from my sins that I'm planting in flowers
Devil got me snorting lines of enchantment powder
Life is a bitch and her lips taste sour
