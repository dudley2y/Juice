Yeah

Time is going by slow and
I'm caught up in the moment
She knows me (It wasn't enough to leave)
It ain't nothing for her to leave
It ain't nothing for her to leave

You better leave her while you got the chance
Don't even stay for another dance
She got a couple other mans
It was all part of her plan
I won't leave
It ain't up to me
This can't be happening to me
This can't be
This can't be

Time is going by slow and
I'm caught up in the moment
She knows me (It wasn't enough to leave)
It ain't nothing for her to leave
It ain't nothing for her to leave
I wise man told me

Raf Simons got me feelin' my soul
Percocet, it got me killin' my soul
But I still feel like the man
Yeah, I still feel like the man with the bands
Yeah, I still feel like the man with the plan
She knows I'll leave her someday
She knows that it's not Sunday
So I'm not savin' a ho

Time is going by slow and
I'm caught up in the moment
She knows me (It wasn't enough to leave)
It ain't nothing for her to leave
It ain't nothing for her to leave
I wise man told me
