Dun-nun-nun
Dun, nun-nun-nun
(Juice did the beat)
Dun, nun-nun-nun
Dun, nun-nun-nun
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, okay
(I want some juice)

Bank account hittin' back-flips
Said she wanna fuck on a Gucci mattress
She a ballerina, back-bend
I'ma probably fuck her from the front and back-end
Then I may hit up her best friend
Tell me how it feel when I'm in intestines
Said she pregnant, it ain't mine, a blessing
Already got children, all these niggas my kids

That's the truth
Signin' niggas, that's just what I do
I'm nine-teen, these niggas twenty-two
And they still my sons
Never would've thought I'd have to kill my sons
But everybody got that one thing
So fresh like I came off a runway
I drink then I drive to my left
What's a right? Then I hit the wrong way on a one way
Run up the money, I run it
I'ma run that like relay
I'ma run that like relay
I'ma run that like relay
Save no ho, no Sunday
Free Smoke, free Smoke for the gunplay
I don't wanna hurt no body
But niggas gettin' out their body
I try to play it off, Atari
Get lost in the sauce, safari
Makin' money all on my own, don't need nobody

Bank account hittin' back-flips
Said she wanna fuck on a Gucci mattress

I'ma probably fuck her from the front and back-end
Then I may hit up her best friend
Tell me how it feel when I'm in intestines
Said she pregnant, it ain't mine, a blessing
Already got children, all these niggas my kids
