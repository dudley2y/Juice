Ayy
Ayy, Gabe, we, we gon' make a Triller video to this as soon as I get through doin' it
I know how it's finna sound already
I don't write shit, I just right my wrongs

I might buy that Wraith in the mornin' just so I could race
Put diamonds on my neck, they tight, like a neck brace
Ayy baby, uh, go 'head, tell me how my dick taste
I need that neck, ayy, call that neck respect, ayy, huh
(Ayy, KBeaZy, you fye'd up)

I might buy that Wraith in the mornin' just so I could race, yeah
Straight baguettes chokin' my neck like a neck brace, yeah
They droolin' over my last watch, wait until my next thing, yeah
Thought he was real, turn out he pussy, he got a sex-change, yeah
Ten pints, I need drank, I need percs, I can't think
Used to be broke, made it work, whippin' that work over the sink
I was too scared of the white police to do a heist or rob a bank
Resorted to robbin' my own kind, junkies blowin' up my phone line

New AP, I'm on my own time
Diamonds HD, easy on the eyes
Always got money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Had a long day, baby, I'm tired
Just put them panties to the side
Yeah, you want this forever girl, thats for you to decide
Bought a mansion in LA today, I'm under 25
But where I come from niggas usually don't make it out alive
I'm thanking God for everything, so many blessings in my life
Yeah, still keep a pipe 'cause niggas love to die (Yeah)
Let it sing like Mariah, everywhere I go keep the fire
A lot of old niggas hate on the young niggas, it's time for them to retire
We ain't wanna come to your party, no way, no reason to invite us
Parties are so last year, everybody end up fighting us

I might buy that Wraith in the mornin' just so I could race, yeah
Straight baguettes chokin' my neck like a neck brace, yeah
They droolin' over my last watch, wait until my next thing, yeah
Thought he was real, turn out he pussy, he got a sex-change, yeah
Ten pints, I need drank, I need percs, I can't think
Used to be broke, made it work, whippin' that work over the sink
I was too scared of the white police to do a heist or rob a bank
Resorted to robbin' my own kind, junkies blowin' up my phone line

Rockin' shows, state to state, overseas
I been gettin' to the blue, to the checks, to the green
On the road, wit my boo and my crew, yeah, my team
Spend a check to get wrecked off the pills and the lean
Huh, now I'm swimmin', ooh
Now I'm drownin', now I'm floatin' with the fishes, ooh
Take a look inside my life and see how I'm livin', ooh
I remember when I couldn't afford a Honda Civic
Now I could take the money from my tour and buy a Bugatti with it
Huh, Exhibit A, I may go pimp my ride
Huh, Exhibit B, fat pockets, Benjamins inside
Highway of life, no traffic, enjoy the ride
I know I may crash sometimes
Still gon' cross the finish line

I might buy that Wraith in the mornin' just so I could race, yeah
Straight baguettes chokin' my neck like a neck brace, yeah
They droolin' over my last watch, wait until my next thing, yeah
Thought he was real, turn out he pussy, he got a sex-change, yeah
Ten pints, I need drank, I need percs, I can't think
Used to be broke, made it work, whippin' that work over the sink
