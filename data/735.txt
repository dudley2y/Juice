Put your hand on my chest
Tell me that its okay
I'll handle the rest
We'll be happy some day
Put your hand on my chest
Tell me that its okay
I'll handle the rest

Tears
I hate it when you drop tears
You're telling me 'bout last year
I don't wanna say that I don't care about the past but I don't
But who am I to talk?
All my good songs got my ex involved
I'm throwing shade with a lil' pinch of salt
Yeah I know your right, I'm wrong
Everything's all my fault, right?
Our relationship is on the fault line
Ain't gonna be an earthquake this time
We'll be fine

Put your hand on my chest
Tell me that its okay
I'll handle the rest
We'll be happy some day
Put your hand on my chest
Tell me that its okay
I'll handle the rest
