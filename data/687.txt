Lyrics From Snippet

It's ok you dumbass

New girl, that's cool
Old girl, old school
Pull up like Pampers
She don't know her manners
My girl flyest
I'm fly, pilot
Two guns like Tomb Raider, 

I do xans, I do lean
But I don't do ketamine
Feel like life is a dream and I'm drowning in reality
I do percs, I do beans
Shit I do everything
'Cause my life is a dream and I'm drowning in reality

Wrap up, latex
Do more, say less
Get paid from the trap house, I don't get paid from the paychecks
She said I'm a Jerry like rejects
I need me a  like recess
I need me a break like Kit-Kat
Break off no Kit-Kat

I be thumbin' through them big racks
I remember up in gym class
When they said I couldn't do that
Now a nigga really do that
Now the 40 with some big mags
So you really need to get back
All you niggas really need to get a ride
I know that be down to ride

Wrap up, latex
Do more, say less
Get paid from the trap house, I don't get paid from the paychecks
She said I'm a Jerry like rejects
I need me a  like recess
I need me a break like Kit-Kat
Break off no Kit-Kat
