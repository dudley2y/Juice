Lyrics from Snippet

...When I hold your hand it feels like I'm in Belair
Does it hurt to say I actually live in Belair?
But it don't feel like Belair when you're not there
Guess I'm going back to the slums, gunshots in the air
Grrah, grrah, grrah

This year, this year
Who would've thought I found my true ride-or-die this year?
Who would've thought I'd fall in love and catch a vibe this year?
I remember when I thought I was gon' die this year, yeah

All my pain on my face, all my hate, all my tears
Every time you come here, you just make 'em go away
On my knees, shedding tears, pray to God, hope he hears
Every time you come here, you make it all go away
Oh, boy I'm blessin', you teachin' me lessons
Me, you, let 'em view, we be flexin'
You beautiful, you be leaving me breathless
I can't breathe, ayy
Same time, girl, you're like 

This year, this year
Who would've thought I found my true ride-or-die this year?
Who would've thought I'd fall in love and catch a vibe this year?
I remember when I thought I was gon' die this year, yeah
