I ain't really finna tell y'all how to get away with murder and shit

Make sure you put codeine in my casket
And some Perkies in my ratchet
Wreaking havoc, like a savage
I'm just tryna catch a play like Madden
Make sure you keep your seat belt fastened
I drive wild and I really love crashin'
I love drugs but I ain't no addict
I'm lyin', I'm lyin'

They say love is a drug, I'm about to OD
She love cocaine, but she hate the nosebleeds
She's dying, she's dying
I'm too busy getting high, no crying
Fuck nigga better not tempt me
I'ma use his head as a centerpiece
He's dyin', he's dyin'
Put an end to his world like the Mayans
Oh-oh-oh, I'm crazy, crazy
Get so damn high, I see faces, faces

Make sure you put codeine in my casket
And some Perkies in my ratchet
Wreaking havoc, like a savage
I'm just tryna catch a play like Madden
Make sure you keep your seat belt fastened
I drive wild and I really love crashin'
I love drugs but I ain't no addict
I'm lyin', I'm lyin'

I can't feel my face, is it still there?
Girl, let me taste, why won't you share?
I still see your shadows in my room
Wake up in the morning and you're not there
I see your face in my crosshairs
Cupid aimin' at me with a gun and I'm not scared
Prolly why I fall for the same damn thing every god damn time
I guess life's not fair
Oh-oh-oh, I'm crazy, crazy
This rock star lifestyle, won't make it, make it

Make sure you put codeine in my casket
And some Perkies in my ratchet
Wreaking havoc, like a savage
I'm just tryna catch a play like Madden
Make sure you keep your seat belt fastened
I drive wild and I really love crashin'
I love drugs but I ain't no addict
I'm lyin', I'm lyin'
