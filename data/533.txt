Cardo Got Wings
Yeah, oh ayy
Huh
Foreign bitch she came from
I don't wanna fuck her anyways
I don’t wanna fuck her anyways

Told her that I need to get away (Get away)
I can't stand that bitch I need to get away (Get away)
You ain't talking money fuck up out my face (Out my way)
That’s your bitch I may just fuck her face the first date
Run this shit like a race (Like a race)
Fuck a Pontiac I need a Wraith (Need a wraith)
Need the money out your safe (Out your safe)
Pull it out and spray you ain't safe (You ain't safe)

Superhero no cape
I go ape I feel like a Bape coat
Heard you wanna hate
New AK give your ass a halo
Gun gon' sing, that bitch just like J-Lo
American Idol my rifle, told her we don't got a title
I could merch, put that on a Bible
Do I love her, shit I'm indecisive
Or am I in denial, I can't tell the difference
Me and fake niggas, can't you see the distance
Only wanna fuck her one time fuck her friendship
After that I may just fuck her friends I’m relentless
Then I kill her boyfriend I guess I’m demented
You can hear that craziness up in my lyrics
She gon' fuck the team, that’s some team spirit
Song so cold had to let the team hear it

Told her that I need to get away (Get away)
I can't stand that bitch I need to get away (Get away)
You ain't talking money fuck up out my face (Out my way)
That's your bitch I may just fuck her face the first date
Run this shit like a race (Like a race)
Fuck a Pontiac I need a Wraith (Need a wraith)
Need the money out your safe (Out your safe)
Pull it out and spray you ain’t safe (You ain't safe)
