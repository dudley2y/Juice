I always been the type to be alone and drown in sorrows
I wonder all the time if I will live to see tomorrow
I can't escape demise, the lies the guilt, they always follow
And almost all the time, nobody's here, I walk with shadows

I deal with a lot at a young age
These drugs startin' to rot out my brain
See, let me tell you somethin' about pain
Walking in sadness, living in madness
I know a lot a people ain't okay
Locked up in their emotions, no cage
The end of the world could just be a bad day
Life is a drag race when you're in last place

Everyone has those times
Everyone has those days
Just make it up in your mind
That you'll be okay

I always been the type to be alone and drown in sorrows
I wonder all the time if I will live to see tomorrow
I can't escape demise, the lies the guilt, they always follow
And almost all the time, nobody's here, I walk with shadows


Everyone has those times
Everyone has those days
Just make it up in your mind
That you'll be okay

Always been the type to be alone and drown in sorrows
I wonder all the time if I will live to see tomorrow
I can't escape demise, the lies the guilt, they always follow
And almost all the time, nobody's here, I walk with shadows
