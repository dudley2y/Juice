Uh
I low-key should have wrote this when I first met you
But, yeah
Hope you like it, listen, here you go
Uh
I'm in the studio early with it today man, it's worth it, yeah
Turn me up in my headphones
Yeah, look, listen

I wanna say this a sad time but I can't describe the way that I feel
This ain't a love song but above all I just wanna keep this shit real, low-key
These words are so overdue
And you, yeah, you, are so over cute
So beautiful to my cubicle when you are around this a marvelous view
Me and you should just take a drive, uh-huh
See the fuck shit in the rear view
It appears that it's clear to you just  how I feel for you
Gotta keep it real for you, when just hope that you listening (listen)
Can't see much, but like Stevie I'm a wonder with the vision looks like it's an interest
Take a chance, hell yeah, with the riscuit, girl we can risk it
Damn, my thoughts are all over the place and I see your blessing all over your face
For you outta this world. but I met you in space
I'm screaming out wait, before I continue, I just really wanna get one thing straight
You make the sun look like a freeze pop, somebody pass me the goddamn sunscreen
And I was just wondering, maybe, baby can you hang out on a weekend or a weekday like a Monday or a Wednesday
Maybe we can T-up on a Thursday, maybe one day, maybe two days, just a few days, just a few more
I don't play games, but with this wordplay, shit, a nigga still got the high score, plus a lot more
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, ah
Uh uh uh uh, aye
Uh uh uh uh, haha, aye
Aye
This my favorite part right here
Listen, some old school shit, you feel me, haha
Yeah

No need to run, I can't run, there ain't no hiding I'm done
I'm gonna say how I feel, then I may roll me a blunt
You tell me quit all this smoking, it's too much weed in my lungs
I say I quit, I don't mean it, 'cause there's still weed in my lungs
But I could promise you this, you get me higher than that
You see that airplane in the sky, well girl, you flyer than that
And when I get this record deal I may just buy you a jet
'Cause I just think you the best, person that I've ever met
Perfect, but better than that, worth it I think that's a fact
I hope you listen to this, think about it, give it a chance
I know I'm feeling you lady, I hope you feeling the kid
But I'm not kidding with you, no-no, this is words to a man
I'll write this for you again, fuck it, again and again
I'll do it over and over and over till you give in
I hope I've caused a commotion, a motion, you to command
I wanna tell you more about it, but this song finna end

Na na na na
Ay, haha
Hope you like it
Uh uh uh
