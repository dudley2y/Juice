Woke up—

Wakeup in the mornin', put my dick in another ho, awe
I ain't fuckin' your bitch, I'm fuckin' your mother, bro, uh
Ballin' super hard, I'm in another league, uh
Niggas tweakin', nickin' if they fuck with me, uh
I leave 'em leakin', choppa on me with a defense, uh
I leave back in the past tense, then it's getting back to the cashin', uh
Pull up in a Aston, everyday bitch, I'm cashin'
Everyday bitch, I'm cashin', everyday bitch, I'm cashin'

Bape up on my cape, but no I'm not a hero

You will get Jack like Sparrow
Won't let her see tomorrow
Put you out your sorrow
Got some blood, sweat, and tears, bullets you could borrow

Hey, hey, hey

Wake up, put my dick inside another ho
I ain't tryna fuck your bitch, tryna fuck your mama, ho
