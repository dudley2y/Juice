(You know it's Mitch Mula)
(Drop dat bomboclaat!)

I don’t love like I used to (I don't love)
But I take drugs like I used to
I ain’t want to use you, abuse you
But this is something that you should get used to
I don’t love like I used to (I don't love)
I don’t take drugs like I used to
I don’t wanna abuse you (No, no, no)
But this is something that you should probably get used to

I know your games
You know my shame
I got so high last night, that I don’t know your name
I woke up from a bad dream to another bad dream
That’s my reality
The demons coming after me
You sit in the cut and you laugh at me

I don’t love like I used to (I don't love)
But I take drugs like I used to
I ain’t want to use you, abuse you
But this is something that you should get used to
I don’t love like I used to (I don't love)
I don’t take drugs like I used to
I don’t wanna abuse you
But this is something that you should probably get used to

Used to
Yeah I know I want to love you I don’t wanna lose you
Abuse you
I beat it up so damn good they thought I was gon’ bruise you
I’m in the cut rolling up, super high, OG stuffed, Percocet throwing up
My heart broke it make me hit good notes
I love swimming in bitches they hit the backstroke
Yeah outta luck, I’m still off the drugs, hey, I’m still off the drugs, hey
Someone call the plug
Cause I don’t really love with no drugs
Shit ain't what it used to be
I’m still on the drugs

I don’t love like I used to
But I take drugs like I used to
I ain’t want to use you, abuse you
But this is something that you should get used to
