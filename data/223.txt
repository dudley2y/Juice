Smoke exotics, fillin' up my body got my mind froze
From Chicago now I'm up in Cali, different time zone
Rollie on me help me face time like an iPhone
Scanner in the Beamer help me dodge all the 5-0
I remember crackin' cards, Wells Fargo
Now I'm crackin' seals in Beverly Hills
Shorty yellow like Marge, I feel like Bart though
Young, full of thrills, that's how I live

Got my racks up, told the broke ass niggas to catch up
I think yo' homie need backup, he ain't know my bro had the MAC tucked
No lack, I'ma keep my eyes up, that lil' bitch not a plus she a minus
Had a gun on my hip as a minor, I speed off and them niggas behind us, yeah
VVS shinin', all these bitches they love all my diamonds
At the top I'ma keep on climbin', watch how the fake friends switch sides
I don't really got time for the fake shit, I'm an ape when I'm rockin' my Bape shit
Hope you know we ain't rockin' the same shit, they hate me 'cause I'm famous, yeah
Keep it on me ain't afraid to aim it, yeah
But you know you ain't on shit until you bang it, yeah
Hit him in his forehead, leave him brainless, yeah
I don't eat with niggas I can't hit a stain with, yeah
