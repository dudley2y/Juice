D-d-daytrip took it to ten (hey)

Baby, I can't lie, you look amazing
Like the models in my playboy pages
Flashback to my immature stages
I done glowed up, i done growed up
I didn't have a lot of words for the ladies
But they knew i stayed dressed in the latest
Now, i got more game than the players
I done glowed up, i done growed up

She tell me that i'm goin' through the motions
'cause i ain't ever showing' no emotions
Ayy, i tell her, "it's over, it's ovеr"
I done glowed up, i done growеd up
I'm goin' through the motions
She hate it when i'm goin' through the motions
I said, "it's over, it's over, it's over"
She's on my phone looking' for closure
I hate when i'm goin' through the motions
'cause i ain't ever showing' no emotions
I tell her, "it's over, it's over"
I done glowed up, i done growed up

I need another doc, pray that dr. god is on the way
A few pills have me too lit, can't be saved
Over and over in a delorean
I'm turnin' back to a demon, just caught me dealin'
Triple nine spinnin' 'round on my forehead
One minute it's nine, next minute sixes
I blame it on the drugs and the success
I blame it on the witches and the fishnets
I blame it on the devil in my conscience
Rebel, heavy metal, demons playing' my guitar riffs

Baby, i can't lie, you look amazing
Like the models in my playboy pages
Flashback to my immature stages
I done glowed up, i done growed up
I didn't have a lot of words for the ladies
But they knew i stayed dressed in the latest
Now, i got more game than the players
I done glowed up, i done growed up

She tell me that i'm goin' through the motions
'cause i ain't ever showing' no emotions
Ayy, i tell her, "it's over, it's over"
I done glowed up, i done growed up
I'm goin' through the motions
She hate it when i'm goin' through the motions
I said, "it's over, it's over, it's over"
She's on my phone looking' for closure
I hate when i'm goin' through the motions
'cause i ain't ever showing' no emotions
I tell her, "it's over, it's over"
I done glowed up, i done growed up

I'ma do what i'm best at, i guess
Try to change the world off the drugs, it's a process
Oh, i'ma ball 'til i fall, baby, all day
Been through it all, baby, livin' in hell, that is what you call it
Don't call my phone right now, goin' insane
All alone right now when i'm stuck in my brain
With a room full of people still feels the same
White m's, a 215's make me feel okay
The devil's set up shop, he been pumpin' shit in my veins
I need a another doc, pray that dr. god is on the way
Satan wrote me a prescription for them blue pills
A few pills have me too lit, can't be saved

She tell me that i'm goin' through the motions
'cause i ain't ever showing' no emotions
Ayy, i tell her, "it's over, it's over"
I done glowed up, i done growed up
I'm goin' through the motions
She hate it when i'm goin' through the motions
I said, "it's over, it's over, it's over"
She's on my phone looking' for closure
I hate when i'm goin' through the motions
'cause i ain't ever showing' no emotions
I tell her, "it's over, it's over"
I done glowed up, i done growed up
