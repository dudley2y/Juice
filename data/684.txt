Lyrics from Snippets

Chop a brick, chop a brick, bitch I'm water whippin'
Roll up on him, 33 shoot him, Scottie Pippen
I been bomin', pull up, pull up, new Bugatti 
All these bitches on my dick, they don't feel no different
Chop a brick, chop a brick, bitch I'm water whippin'
Get his ass, 33 feel like Scottie Pippen
Bitch, I'm the man, you know how I'm livin', huh, yeah
Stackin' all this guap to the fuckin' ceiling (LeeBoy on the track)

Stack my guap up, my hand on my choppa, huh, yeah
Want no problems, huh
I came from the bottom, huh, yeah
Whippin' alone in that kitchen
You know that's how young niggas livin', huh, yeah
Run up on me then I kill him
I swear that my hand on my Smithen, huh, yeah
Roll up a doobie, huh
Bitch, she gon' throw me that booty, huh
I get all up in that coochie, huh
She sucking all through my Louis, huh, yeah
That's how it go, woah

Your bitch in love with my glow, huh
I told her, "I already know"
Look at my wrist, look at my wrist, I'm gon whip it, yeah

Fuck your bitch, pop a xan, I forget it
All these hoes suck my dick 'cause I'm gifted, yeah (LeeBoy on the track)

Chop a brick, chop a brick, bitch I'm water whippin'
Roll up on him, 33 shoot him, Scottie Pippen
I been bomin', pull up, pull up, new Bugatti 
All these bitches on my dick, they don't feel no different
Chop a brick, chop a brick, bitch I'm water whippin'
Get his ass, 33, feel like Scottie Pippen
Bitch, I'm the man, you know how I'm livin', huh, yeah
Stackin' all this guap to the fuckin' ceiling
