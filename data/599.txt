Hahahaha Nick You're Stupid

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Freestyle on Instagram live, bitch I do this
Got good brain from a bitch but she stupid
Fall in love with her, put an arrow through her, Cupid
Glizzy make a fuck nigga shuffle like Cupid
Make love the same way that I make music
F. Felicia, I'm the best when I do it
Lifestyle just like Nike, "Just Do It"
Smoke a motherfucka like a blunt, I'm zooted
Made it rain weed in the club, I'm stupid
High in a bitch and the sky went Cupid
Bad lil' bitch wanna fuck 'cause my music
Got her through shit, got her through shit
Spazz on every track, this shit too easy
Skate just like Truck Fit, shout out Lil Weezy
Flow sick as fuck, I might get to sneezin'
Asthma attack, fuck her 'till she wheezin'
Only smoke the best, and my shit seedless
Quick to shoot a nigga, give me a reason
From Chicago where niggas get left bleedin'
I'm the best, all the beats I be beating up

Listening to rock with my shooters from Chicago in the cut
They cuttin' up
Middle fingers up
I don't give a fuck
Take his shit down
So I can live it up
She get on her knees
So she can give it up
I run up in your spot
The jig is up (Uh)
Triggers up (Uh)
You get stuffed (Uh, uh, uh)
