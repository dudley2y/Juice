Alright, Mello made it right
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Oh my, get out my life
She said, "Why?"

I hit her with a bye-bye, bye-bye
You're out your mind
I'm out of pills
And you're out of lies
It stays dark outside
Even when it's daytime
Like bye-bye, bye-bye, uh
Bye-bye, bye-bye

Um, see you later, uh
Girl, I got a question for you, yeah, I need a favor (Uh)
Turn yourself back to a demon, I'm a demon slayer (Uh)
Hell-proof to the core, take me to your lair (Uh)
Uh, hella persuasive
Hella curved animation, like The Matrix
Percocet body aching, stomach aching
Feel like it's a fucking earthquake where my brain is, huh, oh
Hell's Kitchen blazing
Cooking coke up for slave masters, bloody apron
I remember havin' a dream catcher when I was like ten
Set that bitch on fire, all my dreams been coming true since (Been coming true since)

I hit her with a bye-bye, bye-bye
You're out your mind
I'm out of pills
And you're out of lies
It stays dark outside
Even when it's daytime
Like bye-bye, bye-bye, uh
Bye-bye, bye-bye (Bye)

Bye-bye, bye-bye (Bye, bye)
