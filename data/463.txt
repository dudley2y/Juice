Yo, yo
Trust no one
Told her trust no one (Trust no one)
I thought you were the one
I trust no one (Trust no one)
I thought you were the one
(TheBeatAsylum)
It was fun while it lasted (It was fun while it lasted)
Ain't no happily ever after (No such thing)
It was fun while it lasted (It was fun while it lasted)
Ain't no happily ever after
I'm screaming out, "Love no one" (I don't love no one don't love no one)
Trust no one (I don't love no one don't love no one)
Love no one (I don't love no one don't love no one)
Trust no one (I don't love no one don't love no one)
Love no one (Breaking hearts until the job is done)
Trust no one (I don't love no one don't love no one)
Love no one (I don't love no one don't love no one)

I don't trust (I don't trust)
I don't love (I'ma never ever love)
I need drugs (I need drugs)
Call the plug (Somebody call the plug)
I don't trust (I don't trust)
I don't love (I told you I don't love)
I need drugs (I'm addicted to the drugs)
Call the plug

Trust no one
Mama told me love no one
I really thought you were the one
It was fun while it lasted
It was fun while it lasted
Ain't no such thing as a happy marriage (No such thing)
It was fun while it lasted (While it lasted)
Ripped my heart out then you put it in a casket (Trust no one)
(TheBeatAsylum)
My mama told me trust no one (Love no one)
My mama told me love no one (Trust no one)
Trust no one
I won't love no one
Trust no one
It was fun ain't no love it was fun (Ain't no love)
