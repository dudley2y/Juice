Rolls Royce with the dark tints
No they can't see em
They still peep him
(Of Course)

Double R's with the dark tints
No they can't see em
Smoking green from the catpiss till I can't see at all
Got me looking like a fat bitch living lavish
Money making is a habit and I'm an addict

Outta space I be walking, Mr. Martian
In my safe I hold Benjamin Franklin hostage
You ain't safe
Killers get to him if he a target
Ain't no way I got that outta yo hands
For a bargain

(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Got me here
Pop it Ric Flair
Didn't think I was gon' make it this far
Its a big ole shoutout to my label
They want what I got, so on my waist
Issa big ole Glock, don't you dare
Pointing at my waist, going in yo bitch faces
Big ole cock put it in scared, (oh yeah)
Young rich black kid
Eating good fat kid
Growin' up I was a bad kid
Hung round' the savages
Always liked fashion
I got my ravages
Always when the pills hit em, put a cap in him, (huh)
Mix with the syrup, mix with the gas (bad mixture)
Every time I'd see a bagman with cash
I ain't have any
This car revved prolly gon' run 200 on the dash (or back wit it)
These niggas want smoke
We pullin' up on they ass wit the cabbages

Ain't no way shawty
Don't get in my way shawty
Go bring me a K shawty
Hurry up we late shawty
Don't care what you say shawty
Go get me dat K, K, K
Margiela had to turn to a ski mask (no K, K, K)
I'm on my raptor bitch I floor it
Feel like two hundred and fifty horses
I'ma come down the street
With me and my gang we fade 250 porches
Won't let you suck my cock if you just run
She going in that porsche
7 million dollars in purses
Got so many questions
Spend more money when I'm off the percocets
I hit that bitch with the Juice Wrld swerve
But I ain't like fucking bitches crazy
Party last night was a blacked out blur, (oh yeah)
Gettin' the pussy, gettin' the kidney
Hit it too good that lil bitch purr
I told that man I fucked his bitch
He looked at her and she concurred
Why'd you do that? Are you sure?
She was sober when she did it
I ain't even let her drink no beer
Cuz I wanted her to remember that she fucked on juicethekidd
That's that juicethekidd
That was way before the riddance
