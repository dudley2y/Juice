Uh, I wake up in the morning feel amazing
Hit-Boy
Wake up, huh, yeah
G. Ry got me goin'

I wake up in the morning, feel amazing, it's amazing
Getting faded on the daily, run to the cash, it ain't no waiting
Taking these Percocets, turn me like pages
I'm getting so high that I'm going through phases
Yeah, I know these bitches crazy
Still want her to have my baby, uh
When she get me started, no I can't stop
She took my heart and put it in a lock box
How I'm the famous nigga, but I'm fanned out?
She the type to make a nigga jaw drop

Uh, straight to the floor, I mean it
Percocet pop, the opposite of speeding
She came from heaven, opposite of demon
Yeah, we got a lot of disagreements
But disagreements got me fiending
She's unique, her uniqueness got me to the point where I can't speak
Oh, in love, I've fallen
She got game, Michael Jordan
She rides me like a horse, Ralph Lauren
She rides me like a whore and I love it

Oh-oh, scoring
She is everything but boring
And if she ever leaves, I'm forced in enormous torment

I wake up in the morning, feel amazing, it's amazing
Getting faded on the daily, run to the cash, it ain't no waiting
Taking these Percocets, turn me like pages
I'm getting so high that I'm going through phases
Yeah, I know these bitches crazy
Still want her to have my baby, uh
When she get me started, no I can't stop
She took my heart and put it in a lock box
How I'm the famous nigga, but I'm fanned out?
She the type to make a nigga jaw drop
