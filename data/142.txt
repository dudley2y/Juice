We'll be here, letting go
Chopsquad
Someone needs to let me know
I'm having problems letting go
Overload

I'm having problems letting go
I need solutions someone let me know
I can't help it when I lose control
This a emotional overdose

I tried to talk but you ain't givin' feedback
My depression really hungry and you feed that
You say you love me but I don't know if you mean that
And I'm scared
You've been helping me avoid a relapse
All your love and affection, I need that
You prolly tired of me, yeah, I understand
I'ma make the song bleed, need a Kleenex
Girl you make me happy like a kid at recess
But when you mad, you make me feel like a reject, no jerk
You separate my angels from my demons
Pinch myself 'cause it feels like I'm dreamin'
But when you not here for me the nightmares begin

I'm having problems letting go
I need solutions someone let me know
I can't help it when I lose control
This a emotional overdose

I cannot pretend that I don't care
Hittin' below the belt, that shit hurt, and it's not fair
Traumatized thoughts, girl that shit gon' leave a mark, yeah
Imagine takin' a bullet to the heart, yeah
Nowadays I don't know where home is
But you're the closest thing to a home I have
But right about now I feel homeless
Back to the heartbreak flashbacks

I'm having problems letting go
I need solutions someone let me know
I can't help it when I lose control
This a emotional overdose
