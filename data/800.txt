(My baby you feel)
Uh, I lowkey should've wrote this when I first met you, but yeah
Hope you like it, listen, here you go, cheers
Uh, I'm in the studio early with it today man, It's worth it
Yeah, uh nuh nu nu, turn me up in my headphones

Look, listen listen
I wanna set aside time, but I can't describe the way that I feel
This ain't a love song but a  I wanna keep this shit real
Lowkey, these words are so overdue, and you, yeah you
You're so overcute, so beautiful to my cute beaucoup
When you around, this a marvelous view
Me, you, should just take a drive, uh-huh
See the fuck shit in the rear view, It appears that it's clear too
Just a  half way there, gotta' keep it real for you
Just hope that you listen (Listen)
Can't see much, but like Stevie I'm a wonder with the Vision
Looks like it's an interest, take a chance hell yeah we can Risk It
Girl, we can risk it, Damn
My thoughts are all over the place
And I see yo' blessing all over your face
You outta' this world, but I met you in space
I'm screaming out wait, before I continue
I just really wanna get one thing straight
You make the sun look like a freeze pop
Somebody pass me the goddamn sunscreen
And now it's just one, made it
Ay bae can you hangout on the weekend
Or a weekday, like a Monday or a Wednesday
Maybe we can Tee up on a Tuesday
Maybe one day, maybe two days, just a few days
Just a few more, I don't play games, but with this wordplay, shit ay
Nigga still got the high school up, That's a lot more

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, uh, uh, ay
This my favorite part right here (listen)
It's some old school shit you feel me? Yeah

No need to run, I can't run
There ain't no hiding, I'm done
I'm gonna' say how I feel, then I may roll me a blunt
You tell me quit all the smoking, it's too much weed in my lungs
I say I quit, I don't need it, cause this the weed in my lungs
But I could promise you this, you get me higher than that
You see that airplane in the sky? Well girl you're flyer than that
And when I get this record deal, I may just buy you a jet
Cause I just think you the bet, person that I've ever met
Perfect but better than that, worth it, I think that's a fact
I hope you listen to this, think about it, give it a chance
I know I feelin' you lady, I hope you feeling again
But I'm not kidding with you no-no, this is what you are meant
I write this for you again, fuck it again and again
I do it over and over and over 'til you give in
I hope I cause a commotion emotion you to commit
I wanna tell you more about it, but this song finna end
Nah, nah, ay, haha, I hope you like it
