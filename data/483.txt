Ayy, OZ, you a big dog now, you get to bark
Wonder why my eyes so low and why I ride solo

She wonder why my eyes so low and why I ride solo
I tell her that I don't know, tell her that I don't know
Always tryna call my phone, you not my girl, ho
She ask me why I love that bitch, 'cause she my world, ho
She don't get no reply no more, 'cause we don't vibe no more
And we don't have no talks no more, don't have no talks no more
So do I care about her? No, she could go die, ho
I don't really wanna see these hoes, my girl a blindfold

Usain Bolt, runnin' from that drama like a track meet (Skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
They think that they can but these hoes can't catch me up (Skrrt-skrrt)
Back in the day, it was heartbreak, barely (Phew)
Then I got cuffed up (What else?)
Used to get sucked up (What else?)
By these hoes, then they friends, then their mothers (Ya dig?)
I was a homewreckin', cold motherfucker (Dig)
Now I'm a sucker (Uh-huh)
I'll probably take my girl to Europe for the summer
On the other hand, my ex said she can't function
Without me or my pills in her stomach (Uh-huh)
I got advice for you (Uh-huh), if you want (Take it)
You should die, but first you should vomit (Ugh, ugh)

She wonder why my eyes so low and why I ride solo
I tell her that I don't know, tell her that I don't know
Always tryna call my phone, you not my girl, ho
She ask me why I love that bitch, 'cause she my world, ho
She don't get no reply no more, 'cause we don't vibe no more
And we don't have no talks no more, don't have no talks no more
So do I care about her? No, she could go die, ho
I don't really wanna see these hoes, my girl a blindfold
