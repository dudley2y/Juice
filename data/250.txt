She call me whenever
No matter the weather
She call me whenever
I told her she could call me whenever

I told her she could call me whenever no matter the weather
I'm falling apart, I need to get it together
You lie, you lie, when you say it’s forever
Can't lie, I'm high, it ain’t getting no better
I give her all of my effort, she say it's whatever
I should've put effort in finding somebody better
Now I'm hung like a hook, sing this song forever
No pun intended but these words are a little too clever

I'm in the bushes while she walk home
I'm her secret admirer, stalking is such a strong term
I'm in your bedroom when you're not home
Love is obsession, when the hell will I learn
You never meant to hurt me, right?
I hope that that’s what you’re thinking
You say you got a new man, right?
I have to make him go missing
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking
Narcotic nonsense, I’m tweaking
There's a hole in my heart, that shit leaking
Just hold me close and kill the pain

I told her she could call me whenever no matter the weather
I'm falling apart, I need to get it together
You lie, you lie, when you say it's forever
Can’t lie, I'm high, it ain't getting no better
I give her all of my effort, she say it's whatever
I should've put effort in finding somebody better
Now I'm hung like a hook, sing this song forever
No pun intended but these words are a little too clever

I'm hung, I'm hung, I'm young, I'm dumb
In love, I'm sprung, can't hold my tongue
Wanna shout out to my fans, I know you worry
In my Instagram comments asking who hurt me
I'm in my feelings over bitches that are doing me dirty
I can still see your shadows in my room, baby
You just hit me the other day, a little too flirty
I know you don't want me, you want my money, honey
You can't put a price on love
You can't put a price on us

I told her she could call me whenever no matter the weather
I'm falling apart, I need to get it together
You lie, you lie, when you say it's forever
Can't lie, I'm high, it ain't getting no better
I give her all of my effort, she say it's whatever
I should've put effort in finding somebody better
Now I'm hung like a hook, sing this song forever
No pun intended but these words are a little too clever
