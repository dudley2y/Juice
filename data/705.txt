Ayy

Went through work, sent that shit through the mail
In the trap water whippin' all the bells
Ex mad, told the bitch to go to hell
Ex bad, I'ma call her just a bill
In the trap, send the bricks through the mail
In the trap, send the bricks through the mail
Where you at, tryna work, he got a scale
In the trap, send the bricks through the mail

I'm in the trap with a bad lil' bitch, she really thick
She whippin' the crack, she flippin' her wrists and rollin' her wrists
She know she the shit, ooh, but I can't tell her that
Know she was shit, ooh, I still won't trust you back
Treat 'em like they average, bitches average
This is not a semi-automatic
Hardaway, no Penny how I'm ballin'
I won't fuck, I'm too high, guess I'm stallin'
You know she still callin', wait
Like Osama no Bin Laden, ayy
AK on me, I'm straight poppin', ayy
Gucci on me when I'm shoppin', ayy, ayy, ayy

Went through work, sent that shit through the mail
In the trap water whippin' all the bells
Ex mad, told the bitch to go to hell
Ex bad, I'ma call her just a bill
In the trap, send the bricks through the mail
In the trap, send the bricks through the mail
Where you at, tryna work, he got a scale
In the trap, send the bricks through the mail

12 on my ass, got a bill
I'm Monopoly with it, I'm out of jail
Get them packs, then you flip through the mail
Poppin' xans, now I feel like a snail
Percocet, stop, yeah, huh
Rollie on me, stop-watch, huh
Run up on me, big Glock, yeah
Gassed up, pit-stop, yeah
Fuck-niggas, get off
All of you thirsty hoes, get off
I ball like Derrick Rose, take off
Bitch, I'm A1 with sauce, oh

Went through work, sent that shit through the mail
In the trap water whippin' all the bells
Ex mad, told the bitch to go to hell
Ex bad, I'ma call her just a bill
In the trap, send the bricks through the mail
In the trap, send the bricks through the mail
Where you at, tryna work, got a scale
In the trap, send the bricks through the mail
