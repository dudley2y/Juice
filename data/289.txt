I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long (Yeah)
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song (Uh)
Ain't no telling where we'll end up (Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

Last night was a blur, so, girl, I wasn't sure
If we made love or if we made something more
Last thing I remember is me walking out the door
Next thing you know woke up on the floor (Um)
I don't know whose house this is, but I know I'm in Hollywood
Scrambled for my keys, then I stumbled to the car
I look in the backseat, what do I see?
Bro passed out, layin' next to a bad bra
Looks like they had a good time
I must've too, 'cause for some reason I can't remember my night
Reach in my pockets, what do I find?
Half a Percocet, two hundred dollars, and a weed pipe
That's when somebody hit my phone line
Sayin', "Yesterday was wild,â€œ askin' if I'm alright
I don't know what happened, but I wanna know
I guess we gotta do it all over again tonight

I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up

Here we go again, woke up in a bed
But it wasn't my bed, whose is this?
Vision kinda blurry, I can't see shit
Wrapped around my body, I see two tattooed hands
Last night more blank than the night before
At least I made it to a bed, last time I woke up on the floor
All I could remember is a bitch screaming, "More, more, more, more"
Videos on my phone, we were in a high-speed chase in a white Rolls
Looks like we threw them hands too
Here's a clue: knuckles bruised, and somebody else's blood on my elbow
Lately I've been blacking out, drugs getting too strong
Buying all the pills from the plug, money too long
I get high to let go and find out where I belong
Probably by my VLONE, party with my demons

I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up
