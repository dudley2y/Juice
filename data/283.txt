I'm back in Chicago, I flew first class
I'm a rich man, I came up on they broke ass
Copping clothes, attracting hoes that they can't grab
I'm doing shows, not for the low, I need 10 racks
Did I say 10? I can't count, I need fifty, fifty
Ain't no fightin' when I'm around, I got a semi with me (Ya dig)
You want a feature with your budget, I need a pretty penny
I'm so sorry I can't help it but I feel too sedated, yuh

I was 13 tryna steal a Moncler
Now I could buy everything in Moncler
Give away the clothes that I don't wear, 'cause I still care
Even though I don't give a fuck, I guess I still care
I can't see my demons but I know they still there
Even though these drugs will kill me, no I'm not scared
Chop up Percs in my double cup
Had to take the Gucci sweater off, I started throwing up
Had to put that .40 in a foreign, niggas was runnin' up
Two shots to the gut, he need a shit bag, his stomach bust
That nigga ain't waking up, 911 come scrape him up
Keep a toaster in that Gucci bag, might have to come bake him up

Ah
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na na, no, na na, no, no
