Lyrics from Snippets

I change the climate, VVS gold
I'ma keep on shining in the dark in the cold
Flame won't go out...
...
...I spit writtens
Bitch I write writtens
Take your bitch to the Motel 6 and 
 hoping on my dick, ribbit ribbit
I don't got to wish for a burner I ain't  now
 rip 'em all, lick 'em all...
