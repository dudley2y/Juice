Baby, I'm a cool kid (Mm)

Baby, I'm a bool kid
Choppa fully auto full of bullets
'Cause you know I can't fall for the bullshit
Never been sweet, bitch, Nesquik
How my nigga shoot up your function, function, function, yeah
I get so damn high that I can't function, yeah
We done brought the choppas to the function, yeah
AK-47 like a Russian, yeah

I'm tryna' have a good time
But these fuck-niggas tryna' steal my shine
No, no, can't go, need a Glock .9
Hit 'em, make 'em take off at a stop sign, like a green light
Smokin' 'til my brain fried, bitch, I'm too high
You say you gon' run up, not on this side
You say you gon' rob who? Not this guy
Ol' pussy ass nigga, shot him nine times

Had to stick and move
Came a long way from high school
Feel like I was just in high school
Now I'm makin' grown man moves
Had to stick and move
Came a long way from high school
Feel like I was just in high school
Now I'm makin' grown man moves

Baby, I'm a bool kid
Choppa fully auto full of bullets
'Cause you know I can't fall for the bullshit
Never been sweet, bitch, Nesquik
How my nigga shoot up your function, function, function, yeah
I get so damn high that I can't function, yeah
We done brought the choppas to the function, yeah
AK-47 like a Russian, yeah
