I can't be contained
Ima run the world it's in my motherfucking name
This is real life, it ain't a motherfucking game
Feel like Barrack Obama all I wanted was some change
Now I got a million plus a couple million for the change
Had to change my life I couldn't remain the same
Never switch  I could never change
But I guess I had to change in some ways

It was just me and my manager so I  run it up
And no limit the gang, switching up lanes, pouring codeine in the double cup
New clothes on me that's a one on one
'All Girls' wеnt platinum, another one
Make a bitch wanna fuck  slow up
 10 pеrcs then I throw up
All my friends call me bogus
I had to cut em' off slowly (why?)
 They ask for photos (what else?)
All these rappers wanna get on, asking me for promos (what else?)
Told em' that's a no-no, gotta get that shit on your own
They get hard in the paint, gotta throw some hands
Tryna succeed, try, try again
That's how I got what I got...
