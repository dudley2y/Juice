-last all life long (Yeah)
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song (Uh)
Ain't no tellin' where we'll end up
Daytrip took it to 10 (Hey)

Last night was a blur
So good I wasn't sure if we made love, or if we made something more
Last thing I remember is me walking out the door
Next thing you know, woke up on the floor
I don't know whose house this is, but I know I'm in Hollywood
Scramble for my keys then I stumble to the car
I look in the back seat, what do I see?
Bro passed out, laying next to a bad bra
Looks like they had a good time
I must have took us for some reason, I can't remember my night
Reach in my pockets, what do I find?
Half a percocet, two hundred dollars, and a weed pipe
That's when somebody hit my phone line
Saying, "Yesterday was wild,“ askin' if I'm alright
I don't know what happened, but I wanna know
I guess we gotta do it all over again tonight

I'll hop in my car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up

Here we go again, woke up in a bed
But it wasn't my bed, whose is this?
Vision kinda blurry, I can't see shit
Wrapped around my body, I see two tattooed hands
Last night more blank than the night before
At least I made it to a bed, last time I woke up on the floor
All I could remember is a bitch screaming, "More! More! More! More!"
Videos in my phone, we were in a high speed chase in a white Rolls
Looks like we threw them hands too
Here's a clue, knuckles bruised, and somebody else's blood on my elbows
Lately I've been buggin' out, drugs gettin' too strong
Buying all the pills from the plug, money too long
I get high to let go and find out where I belong
Probably by my V-lone, party with my demons
