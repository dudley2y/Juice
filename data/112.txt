Uh, I need to confide
I need to get right
It's a long ride (Uh)
The drugs help me hide
The drugs help me hide, oh

I need to confide
True love’s hard to find
I'll wait for her to come find me
I'll even pay the fines
I need to confide
True love’s hard to find
I'll wait for her to come find me
Even pay the fines

Okay, it's been a long ride
Still the beginnin' of the ride
I'm gettin' high before the flight
LAX to the Chi
Memories on my mind
Been reflecting on my life
Somethin' don't feel right
Down deep inside
I’m scared of my own demise
I need to confide to the love of my life, life (Life)
It’s getting dark outside
It's getting darker inside
You’re the only home in sight
I need a place to cry

I need to confide
True love's hard to find
I'll wait for her to come find me
I'll even pay the fines
I need to confide
True love’s hard to find
I'll wait for her to come find me
Even pay the fines (Uh)

I'm willing to pay the price for you to stay the night
Bitch, you can't leave my side, the only home in sight
These pills make me roll like dice
Converse about drugs, I'm only tryna break the ice
Bleedin' out, feel like a lost cause
Oxycodone 'til I lockjaw
I need to clean my act up, where's the Lysol?
I been pourin' Actavis to sad songs
Who are you to tell me I'm wrong?
I'm headin' out of space, I blast off
They wonder why I'm gone for so long
Still don't know where I belong

I need to confide
True love's hard to find
I'll wait for her to come find me
I'll even pay the fines
I need to confide
True love's hard to find
I'll wait for her to come find me
Even pay the fines (Fines)
