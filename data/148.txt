Shorty be watchin' me watchin' her from afar
Lace up the Margielas and walk through her heart
Bought a Rolls-Royce truck, let's fuck in my car
Hope you realize that you stuck in my arms
Ball out for you, a point guard
Both our passes left us too scarred
We were in car crashes, racin' through hearts
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Pour the codeine bottle out, 'til it's empty
Sip too much lean, I'm startin' to feel empty
I'ma do my thing, purple, not green
Blue face king, hundreds to the ceiling
Bullets hit your chest like kong, not king
Smoke until I look Hong chong ching, Bruce Lee
So much ice on my wrist dawg, like an injury
Niggas thought they had to cut it off, no surgery
Niggas ain't know shit, dawg
Used to bark on the block, now a nigga rich, dawg
Me and bro run around, lookin' for a lick, dawg
This is it, get stitched up for the bricks, had to Lilo it

Shorty be watchin' me watchin' her from afar
Lace-up the Margielas and walk through her heart
Bought a Rolls-Royce truck, let's fuck in my car
Hope you realize that you stuck in my arms
Ball out for you, a point guard
Both our passes left us too scarred
We were in car crashes, racin' through hearts
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Pockets on dummy, so is my heart
Guess I'm a target, so is my heart
Cupid shot me everywhere, don't know where to start
It wasn't Cupid, it was Satan tryna to play his part
But I disregard, baby
For you I go hard, baby
For you, I will march a million yards, baby
Ain't fallin' apart, baby
I put you in charge of rollin' the gas, baby
And doin' the dash, baby
You ride me so fast, like an S-Class Mercedes
Look at the love and the money I'm makin'
I put Margielas, Chanel, on a irrelevant bitches
Hit her to tell on me, I ain't do nothin'
I ain't do nothin', I'm changing the subject
It's back to this money, I'm keepin' it comin'

Shorty be watchin' me watchin' her from afar
Lace-up the Margielas and walk through her heart
Bought a Rolls-Royce truck, let's fuck in my car
Hope you realize that you stuck in my arms
Ball out for you, a point guard
Both our passes left us too scarred
We were in car crashes, racin' through hearts
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
