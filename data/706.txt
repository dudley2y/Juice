"You Gotta Admit Yourself
You Need Some Help ?
I Gotta Admit Myself...
I'm On These Drugs
Feel Like I Can't Save Myself...
Sometimes I Wanna Take Myself
And Break Myself
So I Could Re-shape Myself...
Nobody Ever Felt The Pain I Felt...
So I Share It...
Put It Out To The Whole World, I Ain't Embarrassed..."
