Life’s a dungeon, chase the dragon
Slayin' everything in my path
Walked through blood, sweat, tears in my Rafs
Enjoy the time, you can't get it back
Life’s a dungeon, chase the dragon
Slayin' everything in my path
Walked through blood, sweat, tears in my Rafs
Enjoy the time, you can't get it back

I'm in the lost and found
All I see is black, fire when I walk around
So I try to get higher, just to calm me down
Till I end up too high, it make me crack a frown
R.I.P. to my dad, I hope I see you in heaven
I hate you for dying before I confessed this
But I love you for making me, you made a legend
Your son is a king, knew I wasn't gonna be a peasant
But I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my thing
While you look down on me I'mma get the green
Make it rain word to Rihanna
They gonna need an Umbrella-ella-ella aye
Demons I’ve been beaten
I’ve been fighting hella hella aye
Life's a dungeon, chase the dragon
Slayin’ everything in my path
Walked through blood, sweat, tears in my Rafs
Enjoy the time, you can't get it back
Life's a dungeon, chase the dragon
Slayin' everything in my path
Walked through blood, sweat, tears in my Rafs
Enjoy the time, you can’t get it back

Life's a luncheon with no food
But staying to myself, I ain't trying to come off wrong
Praying for myself, for my health and my boo
But three words her, aye baby, I love you
Losing my head, feel like I won't give them my do's
Touching my dreads, nervous when I walk in the room
Happy talking to me, not happy talking to you
Hating directions, conversating probably nothing to you
I put them sunglasses on and I put them pills in my stomach
The blunt kush my cologne, crack the seal yeah I'm on it
Not ready for the public, I can't feel nothing
In my mind, stuck in
That's that place, sunken
Sunken in a pit, sunken
My abyss, sunken
What I learned from is
I don't know but my diamonds still frozen
I'm still chosen, just gotta stay focused
Life's a dungeon, chase the dragon
Slayin' everything in my path
Walked through blood, sweat, tears in my Rafs
Enjoy the time, you can't get it back
Life's a dungeon, chase the dragon
Slayin' everything in my path
Walked through blood, sweat, tears in my Rafs
Enjoy the time, you can't get it back
