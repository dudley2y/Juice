Time to get some more money, I just spent 300
I been gettin' that dope money, police think its bricks on me
Gucci kicks $800, I done bought a few, ho
Stomp 'em out, blood on my shoes need some new ones
AF1 Vlone, he ain't got these on
Cowboy guns hee haw, hit his chest, King Kong
AF1 Vlone, he ain’t got these on
Cowboy guns hee haw, hit yo' chest, King Kong

Ya dig, I don't get why all these niggas hate me
I'm in Hermes, ain't no Macy’s
Old money, all these dead faces
I remember prayin' for it in my basement
I reached my goals, I got to the dough, I overachieved
I don't wanna see her face no more, after I nut she gotta leave
All these handouts in my face, this shit feel make believe
Just a heads up, your girl a fan of me

G Money runnin' up the bands with me
If I go broke he gon' whip a pan with me
But nah I ain’t runnin' outta bands
Never again

Time to get some more money, I just spent 300
I been gettin' that dope money, police think it's bricks on me
Gucci kicks $800, I done bought a few, ho
Stomp 'em out, blood on my shoes need some new ones
AF1 Vlone, he ain't got these on
Cowboy guns hee haw, hit his chest, King Kong
AF1 Vlone, he ain't got these on
Cowboy guns hee haw, hit yo' chest, King Kong

This light of mine gon shine like VV's
Mama like damn my son on TV
Choppa like a stove, yeah I got it on preheat
Shine bright like a diamond, bad girl Riri
All these thots wanna fuck, do you miss me Kiki
Get her wet like a Fiji, clean it up like squeegee
I stay with my bros, Mario and Luigi
Got too many foes, that’s why I keep my pole

I'm after blue faces, get in my way then I'm gon' spray
This not mace, this a 'K, bitch
Tie it up like K-Swiss
These niggas pussy, they runnin' away, these niggas evasive
This bitch cock back in my hand, ready to shake it

Time to get some more money, I just spent 300
I been gettin' that dope money, police think its bricks on me
Gucci kicks $800, I done bought a few, ho
Stomp 'em out, blood on my shoes need some new ones
AF1 Vlone, he ain't got these on
Cowboy guns hee haw, hit his chest King Kong
AF1 Vlone, he ain't got these on
