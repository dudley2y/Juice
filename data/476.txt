Lyrics from Snippet

Been tryna feel the vibe, that's alright
Girl you're my type, put your left hand in my right
I'm your best friend, you're my wife
Ain't no flexin', tryna be a better man
I'm stressin' to do anything to impress
I pop a pill and rub the phrase on your chest
Phrase on your chest
Tattooed in ink, everytime that I see, it reminds me
It reminds me of your
Tattoos in ink, everytime that I see, it reminds me
It reminds me of your
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
It reminds me...
