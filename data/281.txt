M-M-M-Murda

Are you feeling yourself tonight?
Do you feel like yourself tonight?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Or put it up on the shelf tonight?
We got a lot to bite into
Good thing I got overbite
Good thing my love over nice
You put my heart over ice, right
But I don't feel like myself tonight
Take a pill off my shelf tonight
I think that I may melt tonight
No, I don't feel alright, over high
Too much hate, over drive (Ya digg?)

Live on a Sunday, I think God want me to do that
Squeeze in a lunch date with your boo, might be what I wanna do
My shoes cost 3 racks, can't use tissues 'cause I'm removin' the scuffs
Adderall too potent, it takes two, yeah, yeah (Wake up)
These brand new Balencis, I don't do layaway (Geek, geek)
And these hoes suckin' me up, day to day (Ya digg, yeah)
And she know I'm not gon' let her stay today
She can't stay here, dumb bitch, you can't stay here
I'm in a straight A, still took too long, but I'm not missin' no exes (Straight, straight)
My bitch in a 2 door mini X, don't got more than two Xs (Two door, yeah)
We keep a gun on us, it feel like they let us (Keep a gun on us, they feel like they let us)
Drippin' with no problem, like somebody wet us (Yeah)

Are you feeling yourself tonight? (Feel)
Do you feel like yourself tonight? (Do you feel?)
Do you wanna talk about it? (Huh?)
Or put it up on the shelf tonight? (Do you feel?)
We got a lot to bite into (Agh)
Good thing I got overbite (Ya digg?)
Good thing my love over nice (Ya digg?)
You put my heart over ice, right (Right)
But I don't feel like myself tonight (What else?)
Take a pill off my shelf tonight (What else?)
I think that I may melt tonight (What else?)
No, I don't feel alright (Feel alright), over high (Over High)
Too much hate (Too much hate), over drive (Over drive)

Hmm, knew it wasn't love
Didn't know what it was
Thought you were on drugs
You say that I am, don't say shit, I shrug
Who am I to judge? Who am I to judge?
Who am I gon' love with you gone? Like, uh
This shit got me feelin' all alone like no
It's to the point where I would want to hit your phone
Emotional, unavailable
