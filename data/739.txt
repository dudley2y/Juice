Everything is okay
I'm gonna be okay
Yea

Everything is okay
I’m gonna be okay
Can't feel my face
But I ain't wanna feel it no way
It’s okay
Everything is gon' be okay
I can't feel my face
I ain't wanna feel it no way (Ayy, yuh)

I'm the man of the hour
Get that bitch wetter than a shower
Dive in it, guess I got super powers (Yeah)
Fuckin' her for a hour
Had to smash her, pass her
Natural disaster
Momma say I'm crazy tried to take me to the pastor
That shit do not matter
Look my pockets fatter
Out of space I'm off the drugs, I can feel my face on Saturn (Yeah, ayy)
You know what it is, tell me what it isn’t
R. Kelly wit the bitch I’ma get to pissin'
Never gavе a fuck about none of the competition
I ain’t nеver lackin', got my hand on my smithin (Yeah)

Catch a vibe on that ho (Ooh)
Are you willin' to die for that ho ?
Are you willin' to cry for that ho ?
Are you willin’ to lie for that ho ?

Everything is okay
I'm gonna be okay
Can't feel my face
But I ain't wanna feel it now way
It's okay
Everything is okay
I can't feel my face
I ain't wanna feel it no way

R.I.P. to Bankroll
Thinkin' bout him when I was countin' up the bankroll
That's the dank blow
Bitch my gang know
10k I show up wit a new phone
I spent 20k within a month
Damn near spent that shit all on blunts
Popped a couple perky's, yeah at once
Pull up on my scene I got my gun
That heat up on my hip just like the sun
Say it two times no I'm not the one
Say it a few time no I'm not the one
They ain't listen so I had to get a gun

I ain't warnin' niggas no more, boy it's no mercy
Bitches sicker than a bitch, ain't fuckin' wit no herpes
Bitches thinkin' that they know me, think they gon' hurt me
Baby is it worth it ?

Everything is okay
I'm gonna be okay
Can't feel my face
But I ain't wanna feel it now way
It's okay
Everything is okay
I can't feel my face
I ain't wanna feel it no way
Ayy
