Lyrics from snippet

I could feel it in my brain (In my brain)
I could feel it in my veins (In my veins)
Perfect feelings all the way (All the way)
Perc ceilings, purple rain (Purple rain)
It's a dark road that I pave (Yeah, yeah I pave)
Taking narcos to the grave (To the brain)
Feelin' real good, but not ashamed (Not ashamed)
But I still can't feel my face (Ah ha ha)

Pills, cigarette thrills, nicotine kills
So does being stuck in my feels
I know drugs are wrong but still
I take them just so I can shake those
Demons off me, as I lay in a coffin
If I don't pop these then I won't be talkin'
The elephant in the room every time that I walk in
It gets annoying, without drugs I can't breathe
Its hard for me to leave
They tell me that its easy to quit-it, funny coming from someone that's not dealing with it-it
Wait, I'm getting a call from my dealer again
He tell me these are the strong ones

They tell me that its easy to quit-it, funny coming from someone that's not dealing with it-it
Wait, I'm getting a call from my dealer again

I could feel it in my brain (In my brain)
I could feel it in my veins (In my veins)
Perfect feelings all the way (All the way)
Perc ceilings, purple rain (Purple rain)
It's a dark road that I pave (Yeah, yeah I pave)
Taking narcos to the grave (To the brain)
Feelin' real good, but not ashamed (Not ashamed)
But I still can't feel my face (Ah ha ha)
