(KidWond3r, you made this beat? Dang!)
Yeah
Won't you fall into my arms?

Won't you fall into my arms?
Your tears fall, it's all my fault
The tears don't fall, they crash around me
Only real rockers'll get that part
She told me that I don't have appreciation for stars
If that's true, then how'd I fall in love with a star?
She told me, that I don't have appreciation for art
If that's true, then how'd I fall in love with her scars?
I told her, take her shoes off as she running inside my heart
All the dirt from the outside world'll leave me scarred
It's been a couple times I almost watched you leave
When you're not with me, baby, I can't breathe, ayy

Uh, I remember I was in New York when you called me
I got some bad news, I got some bad news
I was in my hotel room when you called me
Turned to a sad dude, mentally bad dude
I don't wanna say too much and start arguing
I wanna love you, don't wanna hurt you
But I can't lie, that shit been on my mind
Since you told me, I ain't know how to tell you

Sad face, what's wrong?
I'ma tell you later, bae, I'm on my way home
'Cause when I get to stressin' and assuming the worst
Blowing up your phone, tryin' not to go berserk
When you called me and you said what you said, that shit hurt
Yeah, that hurt the worst
Said it was a accident, I hope it wasn't on purpose
Only been six months, but it feels like years
Remember South by, taking Xanax out your purse
We was high, love on our mind
Heavy vibes, souls intertwined
I ain't gonna lie, I damn near died
When you told me what happened that night

We was high, love on our mind
Heavy vibes, souls intertwined
I ain't gonna lie, I damn near died
When you told me what happened that night

Won't you fall into my arms?
Your tears fall, it's all my fault
The tears don't fall, they crash around me
Only real rockers'll get that part
She told me that I don't have appreciation for stars
If that's true, then how I fall in love with a star?
She told me, that I don't have appreciation for art
If that's true, then how'd I fall in love with her scars?
I told her, take her shoes off as she running inside my heart
All the dirt from the outside world'll leave me scarred
It's been a couple times I almost watched you leave
When you're not with me, baby, I can't breathe, ayy
