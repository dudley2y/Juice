Diamonds dancing milly

In New York we countin' knots, livin’ at the top
AP on me, milly rock (Stick)
Fifty in the Glock
Now we ridin' 'round the city
Sippin’ Wock' and playin' rock (Shit)
I just spilled my pint (Fuck)
Now I'm pissed off
Oh, you don't know what a Perc is? Them be my friends
They help me see all of the serpents
Popping thirty, no tens (No tens)
I took five, that's a fen, had me limpin' like a pimp
You would never understand, it's complicated, isn’t simp-

Life’s simple
He in my way, I could kill him (Brra), simple
I'm feelin’ bad, pop a pill (Geekin'), simple
That's the type of shit that be up on my mental (Mental)
Did I hear your demo? (Haha)
No, I must've not havе got the memo (Uh-uh)
Oh, you ain’t know we keep thе lead like a pencil? (Brra)
This off the top by the way, I didn't use no pencil (Uh-uh)

NLMB comin' strong, this shit is forever
