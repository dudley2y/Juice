I got just an idea
I just want to take her to my hood
Just to make sure I was understood
(Victoriouz-Victoriouz-Victoriouz-toriouz)
That's some Drake shit
(Mula tell 'em, "Fuck them")
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yesterday, I took her to my hood
Just to make sure I was understood
She Kim K with a little Meagan Good
I'm thanking God for everything, it's good

The sun is out, this shit is Meagan Good
The hoes are out, this shit is Meagan Good
I'm really from the wish-a-nigga-woulds
Where there ain't nothin' never ever good

There ain't nothing good about it, not at all
She mix Xanax with a little Adderall
Like I'm at your door, I told you knock it off
Pull up in a drop-top and she top me off
I may pick her up but I won't drop her off
I sip Codeine whenever I get a cough
Rock designer while standin' over a loft
It costs to be the boss, when they die, I pay the costs (Yeah)

Yesterday, I took her to my hood
Just to make sure I was understood
She Kim K with a little Meagan Good
I'm thanking God for everything, it's good

The sun is out, this shit is Meagan Good
The hoes are out, this shit is Meagan Good
I'm really from the wish-a-nigga-woulds
Hey, where there ain't nothin' never ever good

I don't know karate but we still chop it up
Lay him on the ground, now they gotta mop him up
I ain't ever gave a fuck about that kind of stuff
My enemy like her virginity, I'ma make him give it up
Ballin' so damn hard, I think I need a jersey
Niggas super sick like what, you got some herpes?
Sticks and stone may break my bones
But the drugs, the drugs, no they won't hurt me
I was in the cut, brodie tottin' semis
Hardaway the harder way, I'm ballin' like I'm Penny
I'm on bullshit, don't bullshit, just gettin' penny
Yeah, that bullshit, that bullshit, it feel like Benny (Yeah)

Yesterday, I took her to my hood
Just to make sure I was understood
She Kim K with a little Meagan Good
I'm thanking God for everything, it's good

The sun is out, this shit is Meagan Good
