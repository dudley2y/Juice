Gotta pack my bags and hit the road
I don't wanna be here anymore
I can’t hold on, I gotta let go
But first there's a couple things you should know
The day your heart became my home
Mine wasn't cold, now I’m froze

I don't wanna drop another tear
Roll up face blunts to face the fear
I wanna drown in your love, I'm scared of the deep end
You met my mom and my friends, so I guess I'm too deep in
And I won't give up no no, but its takes two, it takes two, to Tango
What am I to do, it seems I fell in love with you
Instincts telling me to move a little closer but I'm scared so

Gotta pack my bags and hit the road
I don't wanna be here anymore
I can't hold on, I gotta let go
But first there’s a couple things you should know
The day your heart became my home
Mine wasn’t cold, now I'm froze
