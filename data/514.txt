No I'm not okay
No I'm not okay
No I'm not okay
I can't feel my face

I don't want relations fuck out my face
Baby give me that face so I can have a good day
How it's all love when it ain't no love
Wonder why I take drugs cause I'm sick of they hate
Now I gotta smoke some, pop some, sip some just so I can feel okay
Everytime I show up, choker and I'm loaded up, fuck niggas in my way
I don't want relations fuck out my face
Baby give me that face so I can have a good day
How it's all love when it ain't no love
Wonder why I take drugs cause I'm sick of they hate
Now I gotta smoke some, pop some, sip some just so I can feel okay
Everytime I show up, choker and I'm loaded up, fuck niggas in my way

How come all the love go MIA
How come all the drugs go MIA
Don't know why I wanna move to L.A
When everything keep going MIA
I rob a few grams and I take 'em to the face
I pop a few Xans and I can't see straight
She wonder where my heart went MIA
She wonder where my heart went MIA
Girl you know damn well it's your fault
Grabbed my heart up out my chest to put it on the sidewalk
Talk too much with your mouth shut the fuck up and just let your love talk
Girl you know damn well it's your fault
Grabbed my heart up out my chest to put it on the sidewalk
Talk too much with your mouth shut the fuck up and just let your love talk

I don't want relations fuck out my face
Baby give me that face so I can have a good day
How it's all love when it ain't no love
Wonder why I take drugs cause I'm sick of they hate
Now I gotta smoke some, pop some, sip some just so I can feel okay
Everytime I show up, choker and I'm loaded up, fuck niggas in my way
I don't want relations fuck out my face
Baby give me that face so I can have a good day
How it's all love when it ain't no love
Wonder why I take drugs cause I'm sick of they hate
Now I gotta smoke some, pop some, sip some just so I can feel okay
Everytime I show up, choker and I'm loaded up, fuck niggas in my way


I don't want relations fuck out my face
Baby give me that face so I can have a good day
How it's all love when it ain't no love
Wonder why I take drugs cause I'm sick of they hate
Now I gotta smoke some, pop some, sip some just so I can feel okay
Everytime I show up, choker and I'm loaded up, fuck niggas in my way
I don't want relations fuck out my face
Baby give me that face so I can have a good day
How it's all love when it ain't no love
Wonder why I take drugs cause I'm sick of they hate
