Yeah, we're laying in bed
You see the— I lock eyes, (Eyes) our eyes lock (Our eyes lock)

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

I'm off the Percs, you don't condone it
You say it makes me act atrocious
But I can't stand life when I'm sober
Take my heart, I'll hand it over
Six months in, it gets colder
I don't want us to be over
Let's make love 'til we die
And let's fuck until we slump over

Be my first aid, I know that you hate to see me bleed
I don't deserve your love, I tend to fuck up everything
It feels like I'm not enough, 'nough, 'nough, no
This a conversation, not a love song

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

I wanna know, is it gon' be forever, or temporary?
If you leave, it'll hurt, keep the tissue ready
Got the drugs on the table, I'm ready
I put Rick on your slippers, no Cinderella
Remember when you went to the fortune teller
She told you, we "need each other"
Ha, what if she trippin? I'm just kiddin'
I'm here to serve a purpose
Girl, I know I ain't picture perfect
One more thing I know for certain
If you leave, I'll close the curtains
Back to the sad shit
Guess that's that "emo rap" shit
In the studio, workin' my ass off
After that, go back just to work your clit
That's as real as it gets, I'm f'real
It look like somebody spill, you so wet
On the pills, 24 hours later, still hittin' that, yeah
Bill Clinton checks
I used that to pay my mama rent
I know that's irrelevant, but
Back to the main focus, I think that you're gorgeous
You love the way that I stroke it, signin' my name on your neck
You used to make potions, playin' 'round with witchcraft
I wonder if you'll put that in my lean and I'd drink that

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh
