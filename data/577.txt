Ah-ha-ah-ah
Hold it down for you, I will hold it down
Hold it down for you, I will shut it down for you
We can run the town, I will run the town for you
I would drown for you, go through the ground
Hold it down for you, I would hold it down
Girl I need you right now, yeah, I need you right now, now
But I need you right now, I need you right now, now
I will drown, take a round
I would shut it down, for you
I would shut it down

But I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'm that nigga now, I'm that nigga now
I'll shut it down for you, run the town for you
Right now, I need you right now
I'm sittin' in my room, sippin' with the lights out
I'm takin' all these uppers so I won't feel down
Like how I feel now, that's how I feel now
I would drown for you
You're my queen, here's a crown for you
Anything that you want, I'll do
Shit, I would drown, I would drown

When you not around, all I do is frown
I keep taking uppers, tryna keep me down
Yeah, they tryna keep me down
But I still hold it down for you
It goes, coke in her nose ring, molly in her nails
She gon' die a rockstar, racin' her to hell
I don't really know her but I know her well enough to know
That I would hold her down, I would hold her down
I would hold her down, I would hold her down
She gon' fall asleep on that codeine right now
On that codeine right now
Right now
When you not around, all I do is frown
When you not around, all I do is frown
All I do is frown
Ayy
