Uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah

This lil' heart of mine is yours for the night
If the night goes right, it'll be yours for life
This lil' soul of mine and yours intertwine
We gon' run this race to the finish line
I love the way you  ignite me, your love is fire
Besides the percs, you're the only thing that gets me high
The bed comes to life every time you arrive
Oh my, the feeling is right, I want this feeling for life

Don't you ever say nevеr
The only word I want to hear you say is forevеr
The only time I wanna see you leave is never
No matter the weather, we're staying together
These are my conscious thoughts, I'm cognizant
Also subconscious thoughts, think without thinking them
Head over heals again, addicted to your skin
By that I mean your touch gives me adrenaline

My ex isn't over it (Oh)
She needs to get over it (Oh)
You get me intoxicated
I don't know what sober is (Oh)
I used to be a dog, Juice the doberman (Woah)
Real love, I need it all
Yeah, I need it all

Be my fentanyl, I'm gon' overdose
You against the wall, you ain't goin' no where
Be my fentanyl, I need another dose
My back was against the wall, the walls fell as you rose

This lil' heart of mine is yours for the night
If the night goes right, it'll be yours for life
This lil' soul of mine and yours intertwine
We gon' run this race to the finish line
I love the way you  ignite me, your love is fire
Besides the percs, you're the only thing that gets me high
The bed comes to life every time you arrive
Oh my, the feeling is right, I want this feeling for life

My ex isn't over it (Oh)
She needs to get over it (Oh)
You get me intoxicated
I don't know what sober is (Oh)
I used to be a dog, Juice the doberman (Oh)
Real love, I need it all
Yeah, I need it all

This lil' heart of mine is yours for the night
If the night goes right, it'll be yours for life
This lil' soul of mine and yours intertwine
We gon' run this race to the finish line
I love the way you  ignite me, your loves fire
Besides the percs, you're the only thing that gets me high
The bed comes to life every time you arrive
Oh my, the feeling is right, I want this feeling for life
