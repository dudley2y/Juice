You already know what the fuck I was, I was bumming in this bitch
Oh my god, they ain't reminiscing

Baby come here (Uh), let me kiss it
I ain’t hit it in a day show you that I miss it, miss it
Baby come here, let me kiss it
I ain't hit it in a day show you that I miss it, miss it

Put them scratches on my back like you know how
We could go all night, no time outs
Pop a perky, now I'm hitting it double time, wow
Thrashing it make you tap out
Quarterback with this shit, send the play
Ain’t got shit to do we could fuck all day (Ayy)
Point guard with this shit (Oh), making the play (Ayy)
Bae gonna take this dick and take my heart away (Uh)
She not with the shits, toting a K
If someone touch her I'ma take they fucking life away
I tell her I'm with the shits damn near everyday
Just so she can know that she safe
