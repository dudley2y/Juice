You can feel it in the room
See it in the mirror
It'll never disappear
You can feel it in the room
Smell it in the air
Oh my God, what is this? An L beat?

You can feel it in the room
See it in the mirror
It’ll never disappear (Oh, woah)
You can feel it in the room
Smell it in the air

You can feel all my misery and agony
She's turning my love into a tragedy
Nowadays I really wanna leave it alone
But either way it goes, it's gon’ come back to me
You can feel all my misery and agony
She's turning my love into a tragedy
Nowadays I really wanna leave it alone
But either way it goes, it's gon' come back to me

You hurt me everytime, got me going out my mind
Drug use got me blind, I've been high in the skies
But I've been high in disguise, I'm not like these other guys
If you couldn't tell I’m high, right now
Yeah, I’m in the sky, right now
But I'm still in disguise
So why try, why lie?
Heart too sacred, she gave it to Satan
Got a Xbox at home but, bitch, I ain’t playing
But if I was playing I'd be a Super Saiyan
Maybe Metroid with the cannon, I'd be spraying
But I can't love no ho, yeah, let me go
And they don’t even let me grow, I mean come on
I can't take too much
Love or drugs (Yeah, yeah, yeah), hey
Love or lust (Yeah, yeah, yeah), hey
Bust a nut, then I bail, yeah
Ooh, dick all her in mouth (Alright)
Cash all on her couch, yeah (Alright)
I'ma make her count it (Alright, alright)

You can feel it in the room
See it in the mirror
It'll never disappear
You can feel it in the room
Smell it in the air

You can feel all my misery and agony
She's turning my love into a tragedy
Nowadays I really wanna leave it alone
But either way it goes, it's gon' come back to me
You can feel all my misery and agony
She's turning my love into a tragedy
Nowadays I really wanna leave it alone
But either way it goes, it's gon' come back to me

Misery avenue, that's where I live
Don't forget, tell your mom, tell your kids
Misery avenue, that's where I live
Don't forget, tell your mom, tell the kids
Misery avenue, that's where I get high, get die, get fly, yeah, word touch the sky
Misery agony, Misery tragedy
That's where I live, tell your mom, tell the kids
It's gon' come back to me
Devil in my crib
