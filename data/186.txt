We don't get along
We don't get along
We don't get along
Mello made it right
We don't get along
We don't get along
We don't get along

We don't get along
Looking in the mirror with these words on my tongue
I've come to this conclusion
We don't get along
Saving myself from myself is a job, but someone's got to do it
So let's just move along
I'm all fucked up, but it's all my fault
But I ain't wanna do it
But temptation is strong
Now I'm left in the cold, let my story be told

Let my story be told (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Pain in my cardiac, matches the pain in my brain
Living in the shadows, you know where to find me at
The place where they don't dare speak good things
Make out session, oh am I late?
Had another make out session with codeine
I kiss her, she kiss me to sleep
Having Hollywood dreams since 2016

We don't get along
Looking in the mirror with these words on my tongue
I've come to this conclusion
We don't get along
Saving myself from myself is a job, but someone's got to do it
So let's just move along
I'm all fucked up, but it's all my fault
But I ain't wanna do it
But temptation is strong
Now I'm left in the cold, let my story be told
