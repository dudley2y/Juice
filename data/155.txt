Where am I at? I'm in paradise
I'm actually FaceTimin', not FaceTimin', I'm slow
I'm on Instagram Live from Heaven, huh
I made it y'all, I'm up here, I'm boolin'

I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long, yeah
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up (Dot da Genius, baby)
Daytrip took it to ten, hey

Last night was a blur, so girl, I wasn't sure
If we made love or if we made something more
Last thing I remember is me walking out the door
Next thing you know woke up on the floor (Uhm)
I don't know whose house this is but I know I'm in Hollywood
Scrambled for my keys, then I stumbled to the car
I look in the backseat, what do I see?
Bro passed out, layin' next to a bad broad
Looks like they had a good time, I must've too
'Cause for some reason I can't remember my night
Reach in my pockets, what do I find?
Half a Percocet, two hundred dollars and a weed pipe
That's when somebody hit my phone line
Sayin', "Yesterday was wild," asking if I'm alright
I don't know what happened, but I wanna know
I guess we gotta do it all over again tonight

I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up

Ridin' 'round town with my niggas
We gon' make a movie, smoke this doobie
Yeah, let's chill a while
Every single night I'm lookin' for a chick to pickup
Now I'm on my mission, diamonds glisten, so bye
Give a fuck 'bout what they say about me
Since I was a youngin' I been 'bout my dreams
And I gotta thank the Lord for lookin' out, the Hell I've seen
And I can't forget my family and my niggas know I got it
Feelin' like I'm fallin' back, no, no
Yeah, the forty-two overflow the cup though
Who else feelin' low? I know you know just how the song go
Praying for some angels, and I'm hopin' I'll be alright
3AM, at war
Wish I fuckin' knew, man, wish I could have done more
Thinkin' 'bout you kid, this shit is killin' my heart
But this gonna save the world, you did it homie, my God

I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up

Got your auntie at my trap house
Wearin' a thong, thong, hahaha
