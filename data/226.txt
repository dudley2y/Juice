Uh, when I wake up (Oh)
Look over to her, she doin' her make up
I'm her blessin' and her curse
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand
I wake up (Oh)
Still could see the Perc in my eyes, fucked up
I know satan's here but he's in disguise
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand

I see her face every day
Sometimes, I'm lost in her maze
Sometimes, I'm lost in her space
Sometimes, I don't know what to say
Plus the drugs that she takes, so happened to be my favorite
The Percocets make me late
Every day, happy belated
I was younger than young, when I wanted drug love
Now it's not what I want, I care too much about her
But I can't front, I still pop, sip, roll my blunts
Three drugs at once, wonderin' if I'll make the risin' sun

I'm worried about you
You ask me if I'm high, I say "Yeah, I took about two" (Oh)
Plus two, bet I still fuck you
Prayin' I make it 'til the mornin' by the end of the night

When I wake up, look over at him
He's still so fucked up, I'm always afraid of what I'll find
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand
I give up
I just wanna get out alive, it's fucked up
At least I can say that I tried
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand
Did I say thousand? I meant million

Shorty tryna have my kids, gettin' her Billie Jean on
But I just want the brain like Jimmy Neutron
Thinkin' back when I was xanned out on a futon
Coulda OD right there, when a bitch had a couple nosebleeds right there
Juice WRLD, Billy Idol midnight owl, I'm gon' yell, yell, yell
Too many drugs in my system, I need help, help, help
I only keep people around if they gon' wish me well
'Cause negative energy literally could bring you Hell

I'm worried about you
You ask me if I'm high, I say "Yeah, I took about two" (Oh)
Plus two, bet I still fuck you
Prayin' I make it 'til the mornin' by the end of the night

When I wake up, look over at him
He's still so fucked up, I'm always afraid of what I'll find
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand
I give up
I just wanna get out alive, it's fucked up
At least I can say that I tried
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand

I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand
