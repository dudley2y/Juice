Sleep paralysis again
I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
Sleep paralysis again
I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head

I feel your presence on my chest
Lately I ain't been the best
Maybe it's because you left
I wake up, you're layin' next to me
Man, oh, man, that's when I woke up again
It was a dream in a dream, reality ain't my friend, mmh
Man, oh, man, time to get fucked up again
I'm gettin' higher than high so reality won't set in, yeah

Sleep paralysis again
I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
Sleep paralysis again
I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head

I woke up to see your face, but I forgot that you're not there
It's kinda crazy, ain't it complicated? Love, it got me scared
The nights are slumberless, I'm tossin', turnin', thinkin' about my life
And where I went wrong and took that left turn, it feels like I can never do right

Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
