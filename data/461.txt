Let's go, uh

I'm a rockstar out the projects
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, out the projects
I'm a rockstar out the projects
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, out the projects
30 in that .40, bitch, we scorin'
Feel like Marty McFly in that DeLorean
Fly as a bird, bitch, I'm soarin'
I don't wanna fuck that bitch, her pussy borin'

Runnin' up a check, pay my mortgage
Trappin' out the window, can't afford it
Lookin' at my name on the Forbes list
Now she wan' explore me like she Dora
I take my bitch straight to Elliot
You take your bitch straight to that Sephora
My lil' bitch so bad she elegant, ha
Yo' bitch I wouldn't even piss on her to give her water (Skrt)
Start me up, bro in the back with the choppas, Call of Duty got a pack a punch (Yeah)
Shots to the face make a mountain
.223s, pack a punch, bag that boy up like he lunch
If they wanna fight, uppercut, hit him with a right and then a left to the gut, ayy
Smokin' on blunts of the Runtz, ayy
Goin' on runs with my gun, ayy
Up it, make it put your hand in the air, single lady, Beyoncé
Ain't come to play, mini AK, drummin' it up like I'm in a parade
Fetty Wap with the guap, make it come my way
2Pac with the Glock, bitch I'm in the hallway
Hangin' out the window, uh, at the continental
I'ma hold that bitch sideways, ayy
Shootin' at opps on the highway, ayy
Caught him in the driveway, ayy
Autumn, got 'em fallin', (Brr)

Hit the curb, make him relocate from his place
No there ain't no safe place from my gang
You cannot escape
You cannot escape
You cannot escape
You cannot escape
There ain't no safe place
You cannot escape, ayy, ayy

I keep it real, you know the deal
In a mansion up in Encino Hills
F&N on me, I got it concealed
Ain't no cappin' at all, bitch I got it for real
They ask me all the time how does it feel
To be able to pay all my family bills
For the people I love I would up it and kill
Anybody that don't want my people to live
I won't say it again, I just pull out and cock it and blow it and leave 'em blowin' through your head
She screamin' "you dead", should've never got in my way, mind your business

I'm a rockstar out the projects
Let's go, uh

I'm a rockstar out the projects
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, out the projects
I'm a rockstar out the projects
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, out the projects
30 in that .40, bitch, we scorin'
Feel like Marty McFly in that DeLorean
Fly as a bird, bitch, I'm soarin'
I don't wanna fuck that bitch, her pussy borin'
