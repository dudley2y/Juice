The abyss
Ally
I love you baby
The abyss, this for y'all

Drowning, in high tide
I sit back and watch the time fly
Then I pretend that I'm alright
Use my hellfire as some sunshine (Shine)

Los Angeles, looking at my angels
Thanks to Percocets, I almost gave myself a halo
Dirty money cleaned by tears, new bankroll
Smokin' 'til my eyes drop tears, then they shut closed
I don't know what's goin' on with me, I don't got time for it though
'Cause I'm too busy roamin' the globe
Fly to London for a show
Had a luncheon in the castle dungeon, all the dragons calling me bro

You're in my abyss
There's no escaping
There's no hiding
This is it, this is all
This is the end
Hm

Woke up from a bad dream
Sip too much Easter pink, oh yeah
My head goin' off of the brick, oh yeah
Ice on my wrist, hockey rink in here
Fresh Prince but I'm a king, no Bel Air
They hate on me everyday but I don't care
Tryna put negativity up in the air
Pray to God that my enemies come to an end
It was way more simple when I was a kid

High tide
I sit back and watch the time fly
Then I pretend that I'm alright
Use my hellfire as some sunshine (Shine)
High tide
I sit back and watch the time fly
Then I pretend that I'm alright
Use my hellfire as some sunshine (Shine)
