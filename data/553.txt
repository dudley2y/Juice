Lyrics from Snippet

Bitches be mad

I need some Actavis I just spilled Wok' on my wrist
Fuck yo' bitch I got lean on her tits
You bought the Challenger
I bought the Lamborghini
Came with windows tinted with the stick shift
My gun like the Actavis
It leave you leanin' like you bought a 2 Liter and poured a 10
My hand on my Reggie, yes I'm 'bout that action
It's not a pump action it's .40 with extended clip (Yeah)
Gucci is rare, they stop and stare
I remember pulling up in that Cavalier
I remember driving off that drank can't steer
Smoking on loud pack, nigga I can't hear (Yeah)
Louis is rare, they stop and stare
I remember pulling up in that Cavalier
Can't drive off the drank, no I can't steer
Smoking on loud pack, nigga I can't hear

We the ones, we the ones
Keep shitting on you niggas like I got the runs
Shit so damn much I need some Tums
Love the way my lil' bitch speak in tongues
Say you not the one, and you got a gun
Well you ain't on shit til' you go blow some
If you really want smoke let a nigga know sum'
My gun gay it'll fuck you then hit your ho up (Woo)
Bitch I'ma do what I want to
My draco come with a kick (Hi-yah)
I taught that bitch Kung Fu, what you wanna do?
Like Hi-Yah!
Bitch I'ma do what I want to
Peel that nigga's scalp back
I treat that boy like a moon roof (Zoom, Zoom)
Put a hole in his body, no Fruit Loops
Draco make him dance, tutu
They gon' make me blow my fuse
Got these hatin' ass bitches and niggas confused
I beat up the rap game and I give it a bruise
Give 'em black and blues, while I count up the blues
Got my hand on my tool
Pop a couple of blues
Then I pour up a pint til' I take me a snooze

I need some Actavis I just spilled Wok' on my wrist
Fuck yo' bitch I got lean on her tits
You bought the Challenger
I bought the Lamborghini
Came with windows tinted with the stick shift
My gun like the Actavis
It leave you leanin' like you bought a 2 Liter and poured a 10
My hand on my Reggie, yes I'm 'bout that action
It's not a pump action it's .40 with extended clip (Yeah)
Gucci is rare, they stop and stare
I remember pulling up in that Cavalier
I remember driving off that drank can't steer
Smoking on loud pack, nigga I can't hear (Yeah)
They stop and stare
I remember pulling up in that Cavalier
Can't drive off the drank, no I can't steer
Smoking on loud pack, nigga I can't hear
