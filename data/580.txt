I love the perckys, I don't love these hoes leave that to churches
Pull up on the scene I'ma merk him
He said I'm scary I'm scarier in person
I'm in the cut with anima
Wet on my water Aquafina, I got my hand on my heater, she do white like Justin Bieber bitch I be high like a fever
.40 on me and I'm shouting that shit 
I don't need her, I'ma fuck, I'ma fuck one time then I'ma keep her after that you won't know her name that bitch a secret (Hush)
Hit her from the back need Jesus
And it's sweet like reecees pieces (Yeah ,yeah)
She don't want it, my nigga catch a body
I can't feel my tongue, shorty, I'm off the molly
I still see the snakes nigga
I still see the fakes nigga
Say real? You ain't nigga
Run up on me I bang niggas
