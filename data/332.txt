Freestyle on Instagram Live, bitch I'm getting this money, I stack it
Heartbreak music, it happens
I thank God I made it at rappin'
Like a poetry slam, I be snappin'
I sick of these goofies reactin'
They just want to get a reaction
But see, I can't let that shit happen
I'ma speak on the real shit, problems that nobody don't want to speak on
Problems that every single one of us deal with, uh
Just tell the devil to be gone
Look in the mirror, like nigga, we on
I feel like Drake, cause nigga, we made it
Look in the mirror my eyes is red, it's hellfire, like my nigga, I'm faded
Fuck is you sayin', run up on me, then I'm sprayin'
But I really hate all the violence
See, I'm from Chicago where niggas be killing to kill
We'll kill to keep 'em quiet
And it's just a problem, I got to solve it
I don't got the answers
I just been lurking, anxiety, tweaking
It got me geekin', it got me shakin'
Don't know what I'm doin' but fuck it, I do it
Fuck it, I ball like I'm Kobe
I'm in the 4th like Ginóbili
You know what you told me
They told me time is money so I need APs and a Rollie
Ayy, run up on me, boy you phony
I may just go pass the gun to my homie, ayy
I got snaked on by my brodie, and I know it, haha
Ayy, yeah
I'ma add you to the murder rate, yeah
I'm the shit and these niggas, they constipate, ha, yeah
Choppa fuckin' the nigga, no masturbate
Pull up on 'em then he just may die today
But I'm not tryna make no one cry today
Yeah
