I wonder what's wrong
I wonder what's wrong
I wonder, I wonder

I wonder what's wrong, I don't know what's right
I'll never give up, I'll continue to fight
All of these demons in my
All of these demons in my mind

I wonder what's wrong, I don't know what's right
I'll never give up, I will continue to fight
All of these demons in my-my-mind
All of these demons in my-my-mind

Hey, uh, I need an exorcist, I need some ecstasy
Momma say I need Jesus, I need to read Exodus
Rollie my wrist no estimate, pay more for the extra glitz
Bitch I'm da shit no excrement, I feel like I'm the best at this
Hop in a foreign and wreck the bitch, I feel so reckless
Drivin' and textin', yo' bitch finessin'
Good head, ass pics
That's from yo' bitch
Ride it like a stallion, do your horse shit

Yeah, oh how the times have changed
Way more money than I had back in the day
I can't take the drugs, I'll relapse again
Real, real, real
Demons from hell

I wonder what's wrong, I don't know what's right
I'll never give up, I will continue to fight
All of these demons in my-my-mind
All of these demons in my-my-mind
