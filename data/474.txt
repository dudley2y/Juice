Murda on that beat so it's not nice

Why do I always fall for the bad ones?
She turned that happy boy into a sad one
Ayy, she turned that happy boy into a mad one
I guess I'll be pissed off until the Percs come
Too much drugs (Yeah), I can't breathe (Yeah)
Ambulance (Yeah), pick me up, 9-1-1
Too much drugs (Yeah), I can't breathe (Yeah)
Who, me? Nah, I'ma live forever

Click-clack, get back, that's for her love
I met her at a kickback then I fell in love
Why do I always fall for the bad ones?
She turned that happy boy into a sad one
Niggas fake, make believe
They don't stand a chance, bitch, I'm 2Pac when I hit 'em up
Fell asleep, off the lean
You a dead bitch if you wake me up
She told me she gon' suck my dick on camera (Flash)
Fuck her off the Perky's, I got stamina (Smash)
We can fuck, but first, you gotta fuck my manager (Smash)
No broke niggas allowed, MC Hammer (Huh)

I'm a loner and a stoner at the same time
That lil' bitch don't like to read but she love lines
Dealing with this heartbreak, huh, all the time
Perky's killing my pain, I'll be fine
She said she a freak in the sheets, yeah
I love her physique, she's a bitch, yeah
If that bitch a feast, I'ma eat, yeah, yeah
I don't go to bitches, bitches come to me, yeah, yeah
Ooh, you don't ever speak the truth
Yeah, I fell in love with you
But it's no so simple
Throw a band, watch her get low like limbo
