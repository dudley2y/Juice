I been living fast, fast, fast, fast
Feeling really bad, bad, bad, bad
Time really moves fast, fast, fast, fast
Better hurry up and get in your bag, bag, bag, bag
I wear Dior, not a fad, 'ad, 'ad, 'ad
I know all these niggas gettin' mad, mad, mad, mad
My hand on my trigger, I'ma die with respect, yeah
Fucking with my money, you'll get dealt like that, yeah

I took too many pills, count up the bills, uh
Molly in my cup, I can't tell you how I feel, uh
Oh, last call
Oh-oh, it's gnarly
Every day I be counting up, counting up the blues
Gotta win sometimes when you always lose
I get high as a bitch, still the same dude
I was back then, and now I'm lost and confused


I been living fast, fast, fast, fast
Feeling really bad, bad, bad, bad
Time really moves fast, fast, fast, fast
Better hurry up and get in your bag, bag, bag, bag
I wear Dior, not a fad, 'ad, 'ad, 'ad
I know all these niggas gettin' mad, mad, mad, mad
My hand on my trigger, I'ma die with respect, yeah
Fucking with my money, you'll get dealt like that, yeah
