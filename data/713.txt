Ooh
It woulda been a right and not another wrong, hey

She told me that it's all my fault
It woulda have been perfect all along
It woulda been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, oh
'Cause it's all my fault, she would've been perfect alone
I would have been a right not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song

She like a mouse in a mouse trap, stuck up
She got me rolling weed now, I'm fucked up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You heated too much and I’m the summer
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you 'round momma
But you let me down, yeah, you let me drown in drama
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you 'round momma
But you let me down, yeah, you let me drown in drama

It woulda have been perfect along
It woulda been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, oh
'Cause it's all my fault, she would've been perfect all along
I should have took a right but I took a wrong
Happy not a sad song

It’s a happy not a sad song, happy not a sad song
I should have took a right but I took a wrong
Happy not a sad song
All my fault
I swear it’s all my fault

I was takin' Xanax, fucked up
I almost had a OD, lucked up
I'm rappin' too much, cuz i'm a singer
I'm married to money, that’s my ringer
And I can't cool down
I need percs now, I need percs now
To put me out my drama

It was all my fault
It woulda been perfect all along
All my fault, it was all my fault
Took a right shoulda took a wrong
Everything is goin' wrong
