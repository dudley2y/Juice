Percy got me stumblin'
Flippin' them racks, yeah, Jesse White tumblin'
Got that sack and I ain't thinkin' 'bout fumblin'
Old niggas mad sayin' that we mumblin'
Nigga, fuck up out my face
I'm tryna get to the cake
I need a crib with a pool, fuck that
I need a crib with a lake
Third eye on the Glock watch out for the snakes
Fuck 12, fuck 12, watch out for the jakes
Fake love, fake love, on the low they hate
These niggas ain't real, I know they fake
Better watch yo step, better stay in yo place
Sorry
I been drippin' so hard as of lately
If I ever go broke with the lick ready
Sack chasing
Just a young shot calling, blunt blazing kid

She ask me if I'm high, bitch I'm blessed
Fuck her 'til her eyes roll back, she possessed
Breaking Bad money like I'm selling crystal meth
Baby girl was black and white, like the shirt of a ref
Let me put all those opinions that you heard all to rest
Fuckin' with a nigga like me, you'll be obsessed
I'm young, but I'm ready
Dancin' like Diddy
Gettin' sucked like spaghetti

Bought my bro a Corvette, it's no more Andrettis
Sharp like machetes
I just want the necky
Shawty tryna text
Blocked like Manute
I don't wear suits
Rich like a jew
Black like your church shoes
Bitch who is you?
Me and Boat getting blessed up in a stu'
Last night did a drive by in a coupe
Twelve on my ass so I had to get a new one
Had to get a new one
Cash
Count it up, put it in a bag
Takin' Percs now I'm finna scratch
Me and Boat racin' in a Lamb
Young niggas gettin' mad, bitch you're not my dad

She ask me if I'm high, bitch I'm blessed
Fuck her 'til her eyes roll back, she possessed
Breaking Bad money like I'm selling crystal meth
Baby girl was black and white, like the shirt of a ref
Let me put all those opinions that you heard all to rest
Fuckin' with a nigga like me, you'll be obsessed
I'm young, but I'm ready
Dancin' like Diddy
Gettin' sucked like spaghetti
