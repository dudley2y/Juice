Lyrics from Snippet

Daytrip took it to 10

Fly in a plane
And me and you can go to mars on the weekend
You got a rockstar boy as a boyfriend
Livin' in the moment
He faking, he phony
The hell make no sense, Uh

Uh, number one, first place
Bound to make the beat shake, earthquake
Pull up on 'em semi-auto, let it spray
Hit his face, he won't see tomorrow, okay
Man down, man down, mayday
That’s what you get for tryna holla at my lay day
Niggas think it's sweet, boy it look like a play day
Mask on me trick-or-treat, happy a belated Halloween
Working round' my side of town, in the back of the Bentley busy
You know I was , my head tryna get dizzy
I don't walk too much, but I gotta sеnse he didn’t wanna see me
Lil fuck nigga talk too tough, I'll bouta' fuck nigga with a sеmi
She gave me her all her love, good body 
Addicted to all these drugs
Roll it up, pull it up, pop it up, face it
Unreleased songs about her on her playlist
If you try to take her from me, Grrr I'ma spray it
