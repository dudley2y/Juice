Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Yeah, I don't know (Classix Beats)

I don't know, sometimes it feel like I'm all alone
Sometimes it feel like I'm trapped in the house full of molly and there ain't nobody home
Working it out like it's cardio
You can get high off this audio (Ah, yeah)
You can get by off this audio
I'm gettin' high while I'm making this audio
And I know I be tweaking (Tweaking)
I know i be spazzin' out hard on the daily (Ah, yeah)
I'm hoping somebody save me (Save me)
Cause a young nigga goin' crazy (Wha)
And I know I am, I don't give a damn, 'cause a young nigga still go
Know I am and I don't give a damn, 'cause a young nigga still dope
I'ma be the man, motherfucker, best believe
I'ma pop me a xan, just so I can fucking sleep (Ah, yeah)
I put silence on my violence, man that shit don't make a peek
Start a riot, we should try it, we should make a fucking scene

I don't know, I don't know
What I am, what I am
But I know, but I know
What I can be, what I can be
I don't know, I don't know
What I am, what I am
But I know, but I know
What I can be, what I can be, what I can be
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't know (I don't know what I can be)
Do you know what I could be? (Do you know)
I don't know what I am (I don't know)
I don't know

I don't know what I am but I know when I'ma be
You can tell me what you want, you're still gon' be a wannabe
I'ma take care of my brothers 'cause they hold it down for me
I'ma take care of my lover shit, whoever she may be
And I'ma just be honest
I wanna travel all over the world
I wanna party with beautiful girls
Man I'm in love with the beautiful girl
She put a molly inside of her body
She said that she feeling on top of the world
I took the molly, can't nobody stop me
I'm feeling so great, never felt this before

I don't know what I could be (Never felt this before)
I take the molly, can't nobody stop me
(Feeling so great, never felt this before)
I take the molly, can't nobody stop me

I don't know, I don't know
What I am, what I am
But I know, but I know
What I can be, what I can be
I don't know, I don't know
What I am, what I am
But I know, but I know
What I can be, what I can be, what I can be

'Cause a young nigga still go
'Cause a young nigga still dope
I don't know (But I know, what I could be)
Best believe, just so I can fucking sleep (Ayy)
