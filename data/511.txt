She makes it cold, without no snow
Girl I know you came a little too close
To take my soul away from me
You pray on love, and play for keeps
Girl you gon' regret the day you let go
Hunnid racks on the floor, nowadays there's more for me
I ball so hard, think I need a trophy
Watch her block my shot, hoe you not a goaly
Heard she love my style
Take a number, sit in line, wait a while (hey)

Ballin' think I need a timeout, get a triple-double now I'm out
