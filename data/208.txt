There was you, there was I
There was you and I
Live a lie, live a lie, live a, live a lie

There was you, there was I
There was you and I
Live a lie, live a lie, live a, live a lie
You ain't love me, you would rather have me crucified
But then a nigga got rich, now you wanna try
Try again

I wasn't your only one, I know you had another man
I don't got time for a ho, I got a girlfriend
You were pretty bad for a slut, yeah, yeah
I'm so glad I ain't fuck, yeah, yeah

I'm so glad I ain't fuck
You ran out of luck, I ran out of love
I ain't want the lust
Show didn't trust no ho like you
You left me in the dust, so it's, "Bitch, fuck you"
You're so last year, you're so out of date
You think that you fine but you out of shape
I love my girl, she makes my day
Even when she's on my case

Her love and drugs, I dwell in, dwell in
We gon' teach you hoes a lesson, lesson
Lesson learned

Live a lie, live a lie, live a, live a lie
You ain't love me, you would rather have me crucified
But then a nigga got rich, now you wanna try
Try again

I wasn't your only one, I know you had another man
I don't got time for a ho, I got a girlfriend
You were pretty bad for a slut, yeah, yeah
I'm so glad I ain't fuck, yeah, yeah

Basic, you're so basic
Tasteless, way too tasteless
But if I had to list all the dumb-ass hoes in my life, then you would be my favourite
Yeah, yeah-yeah, I went there
So please don't, don't go there
I can't stand the fake love
You know this, bitch, you know this

There was you, there was I
There was you and I
Live a lie, live a lie, live a, live a lie
You ain't love me, you would rather have me crucified
But then a nigga got rich, now you wanna try
Try again

I wasn't your only one, I know you had another man
I don't got time for a ho, I got a girlfriend
You were pretty bad for a slut, yeah, yeah
I'm so glad I ain't fuck, yeah, yeah

There was you, there was I
There was you and I
There was you, there was I
There was you and I
There was you, there was I
There was you and I
There was you, there was I
There was you and I
I wasn't your only one, I know you had another man
I don't got time for a ho, I got a girlfriend
You were pretty bad for a slut, yeah, yeah
I'm so glad I ain't fuck, yeah, yeah

There was you, there was I
There was you and I
Live a lie, live a lie, live a, live a lie
You ain't love me, you would rather have me crucified
