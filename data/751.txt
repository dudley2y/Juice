Lyrics from Snippets

Yeah, I'm fighting insanity
I don't have no vanity
The shadows my family
The demons they dance with me
I've been fighting insanity
I don't have no vanity
These shadows my family
Demons they dance with me

These niggas make belief but me I'm high as can be
Yeah, me I am fly as can be
Still fighting insanity
I know my wrongs are right
I know my rights are wrong
I know I had it all along till I made this song
I'm going insane
