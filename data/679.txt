I miss ridin' round town with my friends
.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start nun
Cooler then the boys in the band
Color in my dreadlocks, choker on me, headlock
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay

Now we're all grown up, we all came a long way from the start
We all went the wrong way, once or twice
We can't help that shit, it's life
I miss my old friends, member we was doin' Xans
Up in school, the teachers said we will be in jail or dead
Now I make way more money then them
Hit up the plug, spend they rent, I bought a pint, red Hi-Tech
I miss my mom, I miss my friends, I miss my house, I miss my pet
"Laila, fetch" Mom, come to L.A., I'll get you a jet
Got off my ass and I got to a check
Feelin' sorry for the niggas who slept
Yeah, on me and my gang, cause we runnin' shit this year
Fuck a phone, I'm gon' hold them hundreds to my ears, ayy

I miss ridin' round town with my friends
.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start nun
Cooler then the boys in the band
Color in my dreadlocks, choker on me, headlock
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay

Cigeratte and Percs make my best work
Cigeratte and Percs make my chest hurt
Cigeratte and Percs boost my net worth
Rich nigga junkie, still could fuck your mom
Steppin' in Givenchy, maybe Dior or somethin'
Thinkin' back to when my bed was on the floor or somethin'
Now I count dead, presidents, me in the morgue all day
I got the bag, I got the drip, I keep a torch always
Remember they was looking at me sideways
Now im getting the big bucks, ride around with the stick tucked
Me want no problems, me want no mix ups
I just want dollars, me wanna get richer
Fifty bands in all cash, they be tryna block my Visa
If I see a young nigga richer than me I wouldn't like me either
I keep it on me, got me walkin' like an Ohgeesy
But if he wanna fight, I'll beat him to a seizure
And if he wanna die, I bet Satan wanna meet him
Mask on my face, put revenge on my tshirt

I miss ridin' round town with my friends
.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start nun
Cooler then the boys in the band
Color in my dreadlocks, choker on me, headlock
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay

Seen so much in state its so much at stake its so much at stake
Still gotta put a fuck nigga up in his place
He ain't no i kept it on my waist fuck it went & up it anyway
They dont know i keep one on my waist
Fuck it had to up it anyway they ain't no i keep it on my waist
Fuck it had to up it anyway if he talking crazy fuck it i would buss it anyway
Thats on my mama on my granny on my gang
Already know its fuck that shit you claim
Fuck that click you claim i dont tolerate no disrespect
We be at these niggas neck, Got his bitch she givin neck
Aye she do that for a percocet
She be bobbing percocets for real everywhere i go im down to drill, aye
Everywhere i go im down to kill
I told that nigga this is not a drill
That 40 on me tool i keep a drill
You donâ€™t want no problems over here
I told you i been balling since a kid, Feel like jason kid

End of the day I fucked up
Fell in love with a whore or somethin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, huh)
Push that start button
Brand new car, I can't wait to race it on they ass
Roll up OG gas I may just face it on they ass
Your lil bitch my favorite
Music on her playlist
Down my hair like Satan
Fuck nigga I ain't not playin'
Gucci around my back, keep that semi auto and that
Pull on them get clapped like a round of applause
Yeah, they clap like a round of applause
Circle full of hoes, round of applause
Circle full of hoes, run off broad
Wonderful broad

I miss ridin' round town with my friends
.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start nun
Cooler then the boys in the band
Color in my dreadlocks, choker on me, headlock
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
