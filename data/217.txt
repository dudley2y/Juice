Gotta go fast
Gotta go faster, faster
Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

Can you keep up? I don't think it's enough
Yeah, I'm calling your bluff, too quick for ya
Knuckles, Money Mayweather, raise a fist at us
Emeralds dancin' on my body and they're all chaos (Oh)
Can you keep up? I don't think it's enough
Yeah, I'm calling your bluff, too quick for ya
Knuckles, Money Mayweather, raise a fist at us
Emeralds dancin' on my body and they're all chaos (Oh)

I don't need a car, to run really fast, really quick, really far
If I run through the past, see the cuts and the scars
That's why I keep runnin', it keep me from fallin' apart
From fallin' apart
In order to get really far
Gotta acknowledge where you are
Take off like a comet through the stars
In these red Balenciagas, feel like Sonic Hedgehog
Oh-oh (Let's go, let's go, let's go)
Ain't no debating, they know I'm the greatest
Diss them up then ride on the radio waves
Disregard the people that's givin' you hate
Let your success slap them in the face
What they gon' do to you now? You great
Woke up today feelin' great
So I called Sonic on the phone
And said we should have a race
From the start to the finish, I'll be in the lead
And I'll never slow down, ain't no pumpin' no brakes
Remember what I said about radio waves
When the haters come 'round, just wash 'em away
I'm just winnin' and stuntin' and runnin'
I got 'em like "Homina-homina-homina-homina"
Once I start runnin', can't do nothin' but give in
Welcome to my world, fast life livin'
Gotta go fast, ain't no way I'll be in last place
Get your running shoes out the stash, ayy
The ones you was usin' in gym class, ayy
Don't look at me like that
I didn't know I was that fast, ayy
Three steps of mine is like two-hundred on the dash, ayy

Can you keep up? I don't think it's enough
Yeah, I'm calling your bluff, too quick for ya
Knuckles, Money Mayweather, raise a fist at us
Emeralds dancin' on my body and they're all chaos (Oh)
