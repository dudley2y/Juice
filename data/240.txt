In the darkness where I belong
In the darkness where I belong
In the darkness where I belong

In the darkness where I belong
No new friends, I don't never get along
Take my hand, I will never be alone (Uh)
No, don’t go
Don't go, don't go
Don’t go, don't go
Take my hand, I will never be alone
Don't go, don't go, oh

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay
I'm lost, can't find my way
Sew your mouth shut, you don't got shit to fucking say
Get all that hypocrisy the fuck out my face
Breakdowns every fucking day (Day, day, day)
Energy getting taken away
Drug use got me in a daze (Daze, daze, daze)
Praying it helping it go away
Like what the fuck
Why the fuck? When the fuck?
How the fuck did I get so fucked up?
What the fuck
Why the fuck? How the fuck?
When the fuck did I get so fucked up?

Breakdowns every fucking day (Day, day, day)
Energy getting taken away
Drug use got me in a daze (Daze, daze, daze)
Praying it helpin' it go away

In the darkness where I belong
No new friends, I don’t never get along
Take my hand, I will never be alone (Uh)
No, don’t go
Don't go, don’t go
Don't go, don't go
Take my hand, I will never be alone
Don't go, don’t go, oh

Don't go, ah
Don't go, ah
