I stay in the room with some high guys
I stay in the room with some fly guys
Smoke the whole zip by myself, hmm
Now it's time to go and get some Five Guys
I don't want no stress today, no pain
Everybody's high so it's all okay
I'll put all my problems away for a day
Had to hit my plug today like "Hey"
When he hit me back it was all okay
Percocets have me hooked like cocaine
