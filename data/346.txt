Broke niggas pay attention, here's some motivation
BG on the beat
Ayy, ayy

Broke niggas pay attention, here's some motivation
I'm in L.A., counting cash and Californicatin'
If I want it, I get a 'Rari just to drag race
We ashin' the floor of the foreign and we don't need no ashtray
And we keep it moving forward, we don't ever backspace
I heard you just bought a Ford, I'm finna buy a Mercedes
Early to the money, when these other niggas past, late
You can't have a convo' with me, 'til you get your cash straight

Woke up feeling rich bitch, but that's not enough
Codeine in my cup, ain't no Robitussin
Fuck a pick me up, I really need a Perc-me-up
Me and my homies be doing drugs 'cause all of these ho's be irking us
You said you had a boyfriend five minutes ago
Found out I got the bag, Ksubi jeans, no Balmain
Don't look at the tag (Yeah), all these bitches fair game
Your ho might get smashed, you know she gon' fuck on a rubber band man
I spent fifty k within a month, ho
I just put a zip into a blunt, ho
Niggas iffy, uh, I get on that "Gummo"
Got the sticky tucked, I will never, ever run, ho

You know we can't conversate, you a broke boy
You a librarian, you make no noise
No vegetarian, you want no beef
Think you know it all, bitch, you don't know me
And I can't trust these niggas, they be police
The type to tell on all they friends and they homies
Don't need no friends, I can do it by my lonely
It's only one of me, fuck nigga try to clone me
Mask on my face, bitch, trick or treat
Glock kinda hungry, take it out to eat
Gettin' big, damnit, I'ma have a feast
Pretty nigga shooting, Beauty and the Beast, yeah
