Music doesn't come from your mind
It comes from your soul
Mm, mm, mm-mm, mm
Oh, oh, oh

I serve my time for all my crimes
Sitting here, feeling so terrified
And no one knows where the answer lies
How you gon' tell me what I gotta live without?
When you don't know half the things that I live without
I highly doubt, that you have the same things holding you down

This is me telling you, you would never understand
Things ain't what they seem from the outside, lookin' in
Unexplainable, unexplainable, unexplainable
Even if you look again
Even if you look again
Even if you look again (Yeah)
Even if you look again

In the back of my head, there's something haunting
I know it wants me, to end up lonely
I'm searching for my peace, somebody help me
Feels like I'm about to die slowly
Oh, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round in my soul
It's been a couple years still don't feel whole
At least I found home, she's all I know
So I'll be damned if I let her go

This is me telling you, you would never understand
Things ain't what they seem from the outside, lookin' in
Unexplainable, unexplainable, unexplainable
Even if you look again
Even if you look again
Even if you look again (Yeah)
Even if you look again

You don't know what I need, I need my life
Back to the way that it was
Nowadays, I feel alone
Said I didn't have shit, but I had my friends
Nowadays, I don't really know on what to spend
It's always so wrong in my head
Thinkin' 'bout what I should've said
Could've, would've, should've done it all
In my room with nothing but these walls
The thrill is something I can't control
These demons taking over my soul
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can

This is me telling you, you would never understand
Things ain't what they seem from the outside, lookin' in
Unexplainable, unexplainable, unexplainable
Even if you look again
Even if you look again
Even if you look again (Yeah)
Even if you look again
