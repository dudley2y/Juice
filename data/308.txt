Enviyon on the mix
Baby lion goes
Haha
Where the islands go
Yeah

None of these motherfuckers could touch me
I don't give a fuck if you think you could
I'll still beat your ass like you from another hood
Still smokin' Woods, still givin' bitches wood
In a wishin' well 'cause I still wish a nigga would
Hah, you ain't shit to a boss
Rev her up like an engine until it give her exhaust
All these rappers I'm killing, I'm turning into a villain
My Nina be a horny bitch the way I'm getting her off
Randy Moss for your boy how I'm pickin' 'em off
I'm pickin' 'em out, these other niggas chickenin' out
I'm chewin' 'em up, pause, then I'm spittin' 'em out
I'm bein' general, don't make me start singlin' out
First things first, bitch, keep my name out your mouth
Before the doctor have to take your fuckin' brain out your mouth
I may just show up to your next concert with a AK
Just to see what all that fuckin' hype is about
Now it's blood on my Louis Vs
Bad bitch like my clothes, came from overseas
Ex-girl gettin' mad, said she over me
Knowin' damn well that I'm still in them ovaries
Bitch, please, I see bullshit around me, hoes tryna clown me
As soon as I get money, I bet them bitches surround me
All my money goin' to new clothes and wardrobes
So I can't help but be fresher than Downy
Orange VLONE like I'm straight out the county
Louis Vuitton don mixed up in Givenchy
Same way Hennessy mix up in Bacardi, haha
Damn, so how the fuck you gon' stop me?

Haha, I've been givin' 'em 30 hours, haha
30 hours, haha, ayy
Du-nu-nu, haha
Ayy, y'all like that out there?
Been gamin' for 30 hours
Ayy, look, hah

I run laps around these niggas in they school raps
I'm still doggin' with them cool cats
I'm still pretty when I sit back
I break your bitch for the Kit Kat
You niggas broke, you can't fix that
The competition is a mismatch
You think it's cool to fuck with me on a bad day
And lately, I've been havin' a lot of those
You pussy niggas so uptight
That if you put your big boy pants on
You'll be rocking a cameltoe
I'm such a animal, I'm such a cannibal
Body parts in my Danimals, I'm super radical
Pussy, you not compatible, you niggas itch like rashes
You Clay niggas after me, so call me Cassius
Them hoes used to laugh at me but now they askin'
The whereabouts to all my fashion
If we could have sex on camera
Like I don't have real life standards
Guess I don't have real life standards, huh?

Hahaha, fuck nigga
Had to give these hoes 30 hours
30 hours, ah-uh-uh
Du-nu-nu, hey, hey
Had to give these hoes 30 hours
Ayy, should I give 'em a little more?
I should? Bet, haha, look

I'ma just go back in for another, huh
What's the real definition of a brother?
Relation by blood or relation by color?
Hmm, man, I don't give a fuck
I'm just talkin' to talk, this the talk of a boss
Keep playin' wit' yo' boy and I'll be checkin' yo' pulse
Probably put you in a hospital, piss on your bed
While you in a coma and your mama wait for results
Gone!

Haha, gang
Had to give these niggas 30 hours
Hah, 30 hours, hey, hey
Du-nu-nu, yeah
Had to give these niggas 30 hours
Fuck nigga, haha
