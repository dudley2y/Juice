Lyrics from Snippets

, real life, put pills in a needle
Pro'ly party by myself because I don't fuck with people
Marijuana with the pills, for it goes cerebral
I do
...
illegal
Ain't enough, gon' numb my pain like the pills in the regal
I popped a few, it made me sing like Franklin Aretha
I think they caught up to my brain (brain)
Oh, tell perky I need her whenever I get this way, shakin' and catchin' a fever
