Codeine guzzler, on another level (DY Krazy)
Yeah, codeine guzzler, on another level
Bickin' back in the A’, sippin' on codeine like, "Hey"
Bitch, yeah

I'm a codeine guzzler, on another level
In a Tesla, rollin’ off a Tesla
Niggas tryna catch me lackin', get the best of me
But I got my hand on my Smith & Wesson
This a wave, I'm the ocean
Shorty like a slave, with my chains on
Percocet at the rave, get my rave on
Flyer than a raven

Countin' the riches, handlin' my business
Bitch you trippin', get out yo feelings
I been winning, winning and winning
Hop on my dick, bitch, like Tigger
I need a thick bitch, good figure
Wi-wi-wipe me down
Got it on me right now
As where I'm from, baby, I'm from Chi-Town
Five racks, whip it up, wipe it down (Damn)

Codeine guzzler, on another level
In a Tesla, rollin’ off a Tesla
Niggas tryna catch me lackin’, get the best of me
But I got my hand on my Smith & Wesson
This a wave, I'm the ocean
Shorty like a slave, with my chains on
Percocet at the rave, get my rave on
Flyer than a raven

Birkin Bag (Uh-huh)
They gon’ stop and stare (Uh-huh)
Like, what you got in there? (Uh-huh)
None of your business (Uh-huh)
Half a brick to share (Uh-huh)
With my niggas (Uh-huh)
Got some swishers, yeah, filled with killer (Yeah)
In a Beretta, it's ready to drill (Yeah)
Niggas say that they some killers, they can't do it if they don't got a pill
Uh, peel ’em back like a Banana
Banana clip on me, the Draco is real (Yeah)
Shoot him twice, ask how him how does he feel
Make him eat the bullets like a happy meal
New watch, cost them a half a mill'
I can show you how to rap for real
And I can show you how to trap for real
I'm in the trap with the RAF's for real
With a nigga that'll shoot to kill
I know they feelin' me like I'm made of braille
Keep talkin' brazy, then I send him to hell
I'm off the Perc, it got me just like a snail
With my nigga fight, I'm fighting like Holyfield

This shit right here is a show out
Rich like a white bitch, yeah, I'ma show out
Amiri jeans, ass out
I don't like to sag, but these money bags
Ain't givin' my belt a fuckin' chance

Codeine guzzler, on another level
In a Tesla, rollin' off a Tesla
Niggas tryna catch me lackin', get the best of me
But I got my hand on my Smith & Wesson
This a wave, I'm the ocean
Shorty like a slave, with my chains on
Percocet at the rave, get my rave on
Flyer than a raven
