My life in a nutshell
This is my life in a nutshell

This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven so far away
I'm starting to love hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels
These prescriptions that I feel
Never make the pain heal (fuck)

Back in the lost and found, I go but i'm more lost than found
I know, I feel so cold in LA like I'm sitting back at home, Chicago
They say living's harder than dying, I'm willing to gamble that
Find me unresponsive, in a hotel room, girl can you handle that
Worst case scenario, you still hear my songs on the stereo
You still hear my name on the radio
I'll live forever, forever

This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven so far away
I'm starting to love hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels
These prescriptions that I feel
Never make the pain heal

(oooooh, ooh, oooooh, ooooh)
Death melodies I sing, cardiac arrest knows
I hate to bring the negative vibes in the room
But that's the ugly truth
So much of my life, and time the world's consumed
I'll throw the duse, and grab the noose
Onto the next chapter, none of this matters
I been feeling helpless

This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven so far away
I'm starting to love hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels
These prescriptions that I feel
Never make the pain heal
