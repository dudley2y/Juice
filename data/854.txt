Lyrics from Snippet

...eyes
My lips, my lips to your lips
My, my

My lips to your lips
It gets as close as it gets
Swollen, my eye lids
I been crying again
My stress and problems sitting on my chest
God take them away for a sec'
They telling me that I'm too in love, I need to give it a rest
They telling me It's the drugs and that it's all in my head
So what, so what? Guess I'm taking a risk
Nah, ashamed to say I'd would die to keep them next to me
