Yo
You've been a wonderful audience
And for our last song
We'll be performing “hollywood dreams“
One, two, three, four
Enviyon on the mix
I'ma go to Cali, I will never come back
I ain't never comin' back

I race in a Wraith, ooh
Bad bitch only coming over for a taste, for a taste, ooh
Wake up in the morning taking drugs to the face, yeah
Cuttin' to the chase, yeah
And keepin' it true (Ooh), yeah
I've been runnin' from you (Ooh), yeah

I just wanna feel like the next big thing
I just wanna feel like the next big thing
I'm looking at the TV screen
Like, “One day, that'll be me“

Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
My Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Come true to me, come true to me
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
My Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Come true to me, so new to me

When you broke my heart, I couldn't reverse it
I knew from the start, that it wasn't worth it
It felt too perfect
I gotta run away now
Catch me in a valley in the middle of LA now
I just want somebody who will hold me down and stay down
Yeah, that's my Hollywood dream, Hollywood dream
Come true to me, come true to me

I race in a Wraith, ooh
Bad bitch only coming over for a taste, for a taste, ooh
Wake up in the morning taking drugs to the face, yeah
Cuttin' to the chase, yeah
And keepin' it true (Ooh), yeah
I've been runnin' from you (Ooh), yeah

My Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Come true (True) to me (To me), come true to me
My Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Come true (True), my dreams come true (True) to me

Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Come true to me, come true to me
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Hollywood dreams, Hollywood dreams
Come true (Come true, true), my dreams come true

I race in a Wraith, ooh
Bad bitch only coming over for a taste, for a taste, ooh
Wake up in the morning taking drugs to the face, yeah
Cuttin' to the chase, yeah
And keepin' it true (Ooh), yeah
I've been runnin' from you (Ooh), yeah

Once I go to Cali, I ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back
