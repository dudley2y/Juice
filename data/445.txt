Lyrics from Snippets

Oh (McLaren)
...

...me
There ain't no place to hold me
Fee-Fi-Fo, I'm marching along
Tic-Tac-Toe, three times in a row (Uh)
Do-Re-Mi, I sing for her love (Uh)
Can't copy that feeling, no, can't cool

She got drive like McLaren (Skrrt)
I can't help but to stop and stare
I ain't no grizzly so I can't bear it
Her lips graze my facial hair
I think I would make a wonderful parent
All these niggas my sons anyway, oh yeah
Fallin' in love with her, that's apparent
You can say what you want, bitch, I don't care
Getting fucked up
Run from my mistakes, I'm fucked up
I'm so sorry bae...
