Nay-nay-nah, nah, oh, oh

Smoke cigarettes, cancer in the chest like cardiac arrest
I've been feelin' stressed, tryna find ways to impress her
Showin' her that I love her, tryna show her an effort
Gotta keep it together, 'er

I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the flo-or
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some mo-ore
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the flo-or
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some mo-ore

Oh, oh, this a love letter that I wrote
She keep me up when I'm feelin' low
She's my overdose, 'dose, 'dose
Being heartbroken is so last year
Having breakdowns and she wipin' my tears
I've been feelin' fine ever since she been mine
In other words, yeah, she changed my life
Open up like a book, let her read me
One call away if she ever needs me
If I ever fall apart, I know she gon' keep me together
Treat me like a promise, baby, keep me forever

I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I'ma meet you back at the chorus
P.S., baby girl, you're so gorgeous

Smoke cigarettes, cancer in the chest like cardiac arrest
I've been feelin' stressed, tryna find ways to impress her
Showin' her that I love her, tryna show her an effort
Gotta keep it together, 'er

I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the flo-or
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some mo-ore
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the flo-or
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some mo-ore

As I find my way to the bottom of this bottle
She's in my head, please don't get me started
I could talk about her all day, she's on my mind always
As I find my way to the bottom of this bottle
She's in my head, please don't get me started
Thinkin' bout her all day, she's on my mind always

I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I'ma meet you back at the chorus
P.S, baby girl, you're so gorgeous

Smoke cigarettes, cancer in the chest like cardiac arrest
I've been feelin' stressed, tryna find ways to impress her
Showin' her that I love her, tryna show her an effort
Gotta keep it together, 'er

I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the flo-or
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some mo-ore
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the flo-or
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some mo-ore

I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
