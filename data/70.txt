Lost
I lost, I lost
I lost, I lost

Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Tryna find some inner peace, inner peace

Welcome to my abyss
Filled with sins and trifiling
Fake friends, I hate them
Delete them all, erase them
I'm getting lost in my abyss
Trials, tribulations and suffering
Mayhem will break them
Words from the evil faces

Drugs will fade them (Away)
Pop three, I lace them (Away, away, away)
Welcome to my abyss (Welcome, welcome, welcome)
Pain and suffering (Welcome, welcome, welcome)

Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Tryna find some inner peace, inner peace

It's pain in those words, you can hear it when I talk
But what's a life to live if you ain't got no risk involved?
And what's a slit to make if you ain't got no wrist involved?
Mixin' pills with the liquor, fuck, I'm finna risk it all
Still a cool dude, too smooth, just like olive oil
Known to pop pills, pop niggas and pop ollies, boy
And pop wheelies, ghost ride it, my mind is enlightened
I'm highest, the highest, don't need no ghost writer
Bitch I speak for myself, but my health ain't my wealth
'Cause I'm rich in my bank, but I'm bad with myself
Bombin' like a kamikaze, I'm the shit to these hoes
I set the play, these niggas flock, they settin' picks for me, ho
I came in killin', I'm really fuckin' the industry up
These niggas shady, they really leavin' me mentally fucked
Trapped inside the abyss with a bad bitch in the front
With a blunt in my mouth and some purple codeine in the cup

Way spazzin' on they asses in all type of ways
Pop a couple Percs to take my life away
Nah, just a lighter day, just a brighter day
She doin' all the lines, she had a whiter day
Freestylin', no writers, ayy
That mean when the songs come out I get paid
No cuts, give no fucks
I show out before I even go and show up

So what? I drink Henny till I throw up
So what? It's red lean in that white cup
Pull up on 'em like beep, that's a tow truck
Choppa on me like damn, nigga, don't duck
Duck, goose when I catch 'em
Niggas askin' questions, stop throwin' hatchets
Never had a father, always been a bastard
Fuck with me I'll beat your ass, your head is in a plaster
They don't make sense like spelling rich backwards, I'm madder
Run up, that's okay your head is on a platter
Outta space off the codeine, I'm on Saturn
Niggas got it backwards, dyslexic patterns
I don't believe in you niggas, a nigga atheist
Say this I spray it, say it don't spray it
I'll spray it don't say it, presidential brain from your main, S. Palin
Pull up on the scene, judge a nigga no bailiff
Flow go cold, shine like VVS, nigga fuck rose gold
It's like 50k inside my wardrobe
I get new bitches, these niggas fuck worn hoes
You a whore, ho, you know it, I don't gotta say it
Pull up on the scene, my choppa just like Alizé
Pop it like a bottle, I fuck on a model
I don't wanna fuck if that bitch don't plan to swallow
I told her boyfriend he could swallow all the hollows
Don't believe me, send your location I'll be there tomorrow

Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Tryna find some inner peace, inner peace
