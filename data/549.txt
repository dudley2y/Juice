Ayy, Oz, you a big dog now, you get to bark

I want all the smoke, I want all the dope
My life complex, like my article
I love Percocets, that's my vice, ho
I dropped the one of Wockhardt inside of my Sprite, ho
That was a one cup, didn't give one fuck
I got the gun tucked, fuck nigga, run up
She get one night, then it's adiós
I ain't Blood but I can get real slimy, ho

I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner like I'm Thugger
Fuck your bitch, I'm super raw, don't need no rubber
Ballin' to the point, feel like I'm Iman Shumpert
Mixed the Perky with the Xanny, that's for comfort
I been stressed out
Fuck with my cash, you get stretched out
Boy, am I glad that this rap shit kept me from street route
Still got a MAC-10, I can make you bleed out
Let it blast him
I'ma take the food off his plate, dine and dash him
Always keep a tool everyday, I don't trust them
If they ain't gettin' cash, then it's fuck them (Ya dig?)

I want all the smoke, I want all the dope
My life complex, like my article
I love Percocets, that's my vice, ho
I dropped the one of Wockhardt inside of my Sprite, ho
That was a one cup, didn't give one fuck
I got the gun tucked, fuck nigga, run up
She get one night, then it's adiós
I ain't Blood but I can get real slimy, ho
