Mhm, they're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
Tell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Hey, these girls are insane, yeah, uh

All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love

Now a nigga be reminiscin'
Could've been in prison
Luckily I didn't
All I used to do when 
Wanna catch a  or something
Now I'm in the Bentley
Grinding out, why everyone wanna see me or somethin'?
Count that shit up
 independent
All that two shows
Did that shit
Get up in it, yuh
VVS' all in it, uh
Got a bitch checking her vision, uh
75 on my wrist or somethin'
She don't care 'bout her nigga or nothin'
She never seen six figures at once
I know niggas with big ol' bags
I got ones that bigger than one
Shoot you nigga  in a month

Ah

Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
