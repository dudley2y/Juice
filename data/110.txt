I'ma crash the Bentley truck if you think 'bout breaking up
Girl, this is forever, girl, this is forever love
I'ma crash the Bentley truck if you think 'bout breaking up
Girl, this is forever, girl, this is forever love

Huh, we climb and keep climbin'
Gon' ride and recline
I guess I'm just as real as the promise (Girl, this is forever love, this is forever love)

You made me, heaven where you take me
Molly keep me up, but the percy keep me spacy (Spacy)
Xanny is so last year, Lotti is amazing
Lotti took me places that the drugs couldn't take me
I'm in the crowd raging, uh, on the front pages
This shit is outrageous, this kid's amazing
It's crazy where a few heartbreak songs will take you
You'll find true love one day, I know I was able
Feels like I can't eat dinner if she ain't sitting at the table
True love feel like a fairy tale fable
Got me lost for words, uh, I don't know what to say to you
But I love you
Yeah, I love you

I'ma crash the Bentley truck if you think 'bout breaking up
Girl, this is forever, girl, this is forever love
I'ma crash the Bentley truck if you think 'bout breaking up
Girl, this is forever, girl, this is forever love

Huh, we climb and keep climbin'
Gon' ride and recline
I guess I'm just as real as the promise (Girl, this is forever love, this is forever love)

I made you, heaven where I'll take you
Even though you fell from the heavens, you're a angel
I been put through hell to get to heaven, and I'm thankful
Cupid knocked me out, you were there when I came too (Came too)
Let's make moves
Let's break rules
The three words I choose
I love you

I'ma crash the Bentley truck if you think about breaking up
Girl, this is forever, girl, this is forever love
I'ma crash the Bentley truck if you think about breaking up
Girl, this is forever, girl, this is forever love (This is forever love, forever love)

Huh, we climb and keep climbin'
Gon' ride and recline
I guess I'm just as real as the promise (Girl this is forever love, this is forever love, this is)

I'ma crash the Bentley truck if you think 'bout breaking up
Girl, this is forever, girl, this is forever love
I'ma crash the Bentley truck if you think 'bout breaking up
Girl, this is forever, girl, this is forever love (This is forever love)

Huh, we climb and keep climbin'
Gon' ride and recline
I guess I'm just as real as the promise (Girl, this is forever love, this is forever love, this is forever love)
