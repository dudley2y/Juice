Lyrics from Snippet

Tell me it ain't so
Tell me it ain't so
Tell me it ain't so
Tell me you ain't go
Tell me you ain't go
Tell me it ain't so
We're here no more

The only ho I would wait for
I hit your pimp up every weeks or so
You told me you were finna go and recruit more
Maybe that means he'll drop the price on you
And, "Make me" inspired his words
You 30 years old but you still look perfect
Two of you just need too much
Not two of you is not enough

Tell me it ain't so
You found a new home
I tried to move on
My new bitch lives in styrofoam

Tell me it ain't so
Tell me it ain't so
Tell me it ain't so
Tell me you ain't go
Tell me you ain't go
Tell me it ain't so
We're here no more
