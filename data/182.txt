G-Money just bought a pound of the Gushers, we've been smokin’ exotic product
G-Money just bought a pound of the Gushers, we've been smokin' exotic product
Modern-day rockstar, feel like Ozzy, honestly
G-Money just bought a pound of the Gushers, we’ve been smokin', yeah

G-Money just bought a pound of the Gushers, we've been smokin' exotic product
Was robbin' and juggin' with road runners, every day whippin', keeping the stove jumpin'
I just went found me some Actavis, I’ve been havin’ an out of body
I grew up sippin' green, I was on one, I remember the first day of the purple comin’

I get so high I panic, off of the medi—, send me the medic, medic
These hoes are not entertainin', fuck am I sayin'?
I'm too busy counting the fetty
We keep them guns on us, you know we war-ready
My gun sing like Mariah, so I love to carry it
If he talk out his neck then on mom, I’m gon' bury 'em
If this bitch is a keeper, I'll take her then marry her
Fuck her friends in a Tahoe, the more is the merrier
There was Susie and Anna and Lisa and Mary or somethin'
I think her name Mary or somethin'
But I couldn't tell this, you know I be high as a dummy
I don't take these Perky's for nothin'
Get so high, it's embarrassin', but I don't be rememberin' names
But it's okay, don't matter how you play, as long as you play the game (Let's go!)

Talkin' that lean talk (Talkin' that talk)
Talkin' that lean talk (Talkin' that talk)
Talkin' that perc talk, talkin' that bean talk (Kel-Tec, Tec)
Talkin' bout the scope on the rifle, choppa with a beam on 'em
Talkin' bout the bitch with a fat ol' ass, finna let 'em get up on it
I'm livin' life like I'm Makaveli, wanna kill me then I got the MAC-11
I got a bitch with her own money, in my bank, got more green than a Packers player
I'm livin' life like a cowboy with this Glizzy on me, no revolver
I'm not ordinary, I can't go in the mall
Barney's private shoppin', one call (Uh-huh)
Phone call, for my bros
They really miss me back home (Uh-huh)
All the hoes want dick from back home (Uh-huh)
And wouldn't try to fuck me when I was broke (Uh-huh)
Now they want me to make time for 'em (Uh-huh)
Half of me sayin', "Fuck it, give 'em consent forms" (Uh-huh)
My main girl like a 911 new Porsche
And I ain't tryna smoke that one, no Newport
