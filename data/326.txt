(In the studio, ay)
I just started this, and I'm on Live, nigga
Uh,  no see,  no see (Uh, uh-huh)

Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps
If they play with you, we finna spray then leave
Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps
Baby, if they play with you, we finna spray and leave
Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps, yeah
If they play with you, we finna spray then leave
Don't you run away from me, don't you run away from me
Don't you run away from me, don't you run away from me
Don't you run away from me, run away from me

Don't you run away from me
I told you baby that you're all I need, uh-huh
Ex bitch tryna act like me
She tryna run away with the drip, I see
Two tone skeleton on my wrist, icey
Make her want some ice cream
My eyes low from smokin' doja, damn I need some Visine
Tryna keep my composure but all these people try me
I'm with No Limit, they soldiers, they'll stick you like an IV
I can tell you really like me
I enjoy your vibe and appreciate the company
Look up at the sky, lovely
See the same thing when I look at that look in your eyes
Broke the internet when I kicked that bitch to the side
Goes to show you can't disrespect my love and hope to slide
Niggas think it's sweet 'cause the love songs, right?
That's cool, 'cause they won't be expectin' me to slide

Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps
If they play with you, we finna spray then leave
Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps
Baby, if they play with you, we finna spray and leave
Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps, yeah
If they play with you, we finna spray then leave
Don't you run away from me, don't you run away from me
Don't you run away from me, don't you run away from me
Don't you run away from me, run away from me


Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps
If they play with you, we finna spray then leave
Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps
Baby, if they play with you, we finna spray and leave
Don't you run away from me, I'm tryna play for keeps, yeah
If they play with you, we finna spray then leave
Don't you run away from me, don't you run away from me
Don't you run away from me, don't you run away from me
Don't you run away from me, run away from me
