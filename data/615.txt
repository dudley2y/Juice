Oh, oh, mmm
No more codeine, hey
(Mula tell 'em fall through)

Got invited to this 27 club
27 drugs, 27 plugs
Still don’t show me love
27 club, 27 club, 27 club
Got invited to the 27 club
27 drugs, 27 plugs
Still don't show me love
In the 27 club, 19 in the 27 club, huh

Yeah, I met her in the club
Personify a drug
Molly or one
But it feel like a ton
27 club, 27 club
Still don't get no love in the 27 club

Drugs getting way too strong, money getting way too long
I’m just tryna' right my wrongs, without tryna write these songs
I been getting way too high, 'cause I been feeling way too low
God keep sayin', "Yes," devil keep sayin', "No"
I'm still in Hell with it, OG, hear the smell of it, huh
I keep inhalin' it, so hot, I'm in Hell with it
I been getting way too high, I been feeling way too low
If she can’t match my fly, thеn she gotta go
I am on a roll, ball that shit like pick and roll
Ball so hard like fingеr roll, eyes too red, no demon, woah
I’m lost in my mind, I'm too hypnotized
Lookin’ for me why?

Got invited to this 27 club
