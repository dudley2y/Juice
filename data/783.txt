Lyrics from Snippet

I just left a bad bitch for another one
Off a perky, but I think I need another one
Got a .40, but I think I need another one
DJ Khaled, I'ma hit 'em with another one
You don't me, you know where I came from
Creepin' on the come-up, bitch I feel like Bone Thugs
She throw a temper tantrum until she get some more drugs
Oh well, I got another one
