I'm a rockstar, my brother with that stick talk (Stick)
We don't say shit at all, we don't like that shit talk
Ain't no off days at all, but we get them bricks off (Brick, brick)
I sip Wockhardt (Lean)
With the moonrock (Skrt)
In that Bentley truck, yes I feel exotic
Your shit ain't there yet (Yeah)
Put some drip on it (Yeah)
I'll take your whole check (Yeah)
And then I shit on it

Rollie white as fuck, like I just put a brick on it (What else?)
Your Rollie fake as fuck, boy you can hear the tick on it
The way she sucked me up, I thought it was a tick on me (Ooh)
