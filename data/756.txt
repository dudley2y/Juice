Listening to White Wine
Cash flow
Fuck about the past hoe
Fuck about her past hoes I'm past those

Sippin' till my heart stop and my jaw lock
I just made her jaw drop from a backshot
I ain't feelin' no love I need more love
More drugs need a new plug
I can't stop myself from going down this road
I need a jacket ain't know it was this cold
Love me when the times right
Codeine on my timeline sleeping on her timeline

Sipping too much
All these fuckin' posers, imitators on my timeline
Cross my heart and hope to die been praying for a flatline
Percocet withdrawals make me realize what it feel like
Lately, I've been in my feelings listening to White Wine
Sad souls with some cash flow
Never gave a fuck about the past no
Never gave a fuck about her past hoes I'm past those

Sippin' till my heart stop and my jaw lock
Sippin' till my heart stop and my jaw lock
I just made her jaw drop from a backshot

Sippin' till my heart stop and my jaw lock
I just made her jaw drop from a backshot
I ain't feelin' no love I need more love
More drugs need a new plug
I can't stop myself from going down this road
I need a jacket ain't know it was this cold
Love me when the times right
Codeine on my timeline sleeping on her timeline

Listen to my story, hella downfalls
Hella downfalls, yeah
 been a plug, yeah
She made me fall in love, yeah
Not no ordinary drug, yeah
Sippin' till my heart stop, 'till my jaw lock
Damn it now my jaw locked
I'm fucked up
They think that they know us, they don't know us
So what, 50k a show or ion show up yeah
You can live on through me
Keep going strong through me
A musical misery

Sippin' till my heart stop and my jaw lock
I just made her jaw drop from a backshot
I ain't feelin' no love I need more love
More drugs need a new plug
I can't stop myself from going down this road
I need a jacket ain't know it was this cold
Love me when the times right
Codeine on my timeline sleeping on her timeline

Sippin' too much
Keep going strong through me
A musical misery fucking me I'm mentally is that where I'm meant to be?
Is that where I'm meant to be?
