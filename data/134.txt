Woah

I'm not where I need to be
Come take what you need from me
Keep my thoughts in secrecy
You don’t know what that means to me
Everybody got they low points
Feel like everyone needs to bleed
I don't have no reasoning
Someone come and set me free, uh

We can leave the past behind us, plus
We don't gotta be a minus, love
We can leave the past behind us, plus
We don’t gotta be a minus, love

We can add more to the equation
I ain't really tryin' to minus drugs
Everybody loves Juice, who the fuck is Raymond?
Baby, I'ma ball hard 'til the life game end
Oh, exposin' my flaws, truth stickin' to my job, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, exposin' these hoes, ’cause hoes always gon’ be hoes, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pour another four, I'm in slow motion, I don’t wanna take it there
Perc pop, I don't play fair, play fair
I've been gettin' way more buzz than light-year, oh

I’m not where I need to be
Come take what you need from me
Keep my thoughts in secrecy
You don't know what that means to me
Everybody got they low points
Feel like everyone needs to bleed
I don't have no reasoning
Someone come and set me free

I'm not where I need to be
Come take what you need from me
Keep my thoughts in secrecy
You don't know what that means to me
Everybody got they low points
Feel like everyone needs to bleed
I don't have no reasoning
Someone come and set me free

No, you never know, you never know
How to deal with all the cold
You think a house on the Hills gon' keep you home
Think them VVS diamonds protect your soul
Every day I been grindin', I'm on my own
Don't got time for no charmin', I'm on the road
I've been changin' the climate with all these flows
Kinda like, cold to hot
Nigga, you know I'm over hot
I just got top from a super thot
I'ma pull up on any block
.40 make a nigga dance, no milly rock
I don't give a fuck if you here or not
Just know that the end is near so plot
What you gon' do next?
Better get to a check, while you got life left
I done came a long way from sittin' in the projects
Fuck with me the long way, long way
Just don't fuck with me the wrong way
Some of these niggas and bitches, rub me the wrong way
You mad 'cause I got the rock on me like Beyoncé
Took my bitch to an island, no Bombay
Smokin' 'til I look Thailand, karate
No offense, niggas nowadays are so sensitive
If rappers gotta watch what we say, what's the point of it?
(What's the point of it?)

Oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh)

Woah

I'm not where I need to be
Come take what you need from me
Keep my thoughts in secrecy

Everybody got they low points
Feel like everyone needs to bleed
I don't have no reasoning
Someone come and set me free (Set me free)
