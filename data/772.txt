Solo cup, yeah
 Need a remedy
Even Xanax or Hennessey

If he want smoke, he a dummy
Imma run it, imma run it, I ain't runnin' out of money
I keep it one hunnid
Lol to the bank, to you niggas its not funny
G Money got me sippin' hard, ayy
With the offwhite jeans on me
I asked bro what time it is
He said its time to get some money

Never sober, far from it
I like drugs, mom I'm sorry
Xanny, Perky, Henny, plenty
Balla, Hardaway, Penny, ayy
Bro said he finna give me a semi, ayy
I want a 30 clip so it can hold plenty
Girlfriends, I got too many
And they all hurt me
Thats why the drugs working

If he want smoke, he a dummy
Imma run it, imma run it, I ain't runnin' out of money
I keep it one hunnid
Lol to the bank, to you niggas its not funny
G Money got me sippin' hard, ayy
With the offwhite jeans on me
I asked bro what time it is
He said its time to get some money

He said it's time to get some money
Fuck twelve, they be tryna take it from me
Free my brother Jody, even though that he's a dummy
And free TY, he be dumpin'
I really hope these bitches love me
Don't matter if I'm ugly cause I'm gettin' money
I know a lot of girls in my past hurt me
Its all good, I'ma shoot they boyfriend with a .40
I'm crazy
The drugs make me crazy
There's funerals for goofy hoes
Start pickin' up Stacys'

If he want smoke, he a dummy
Imma run it, imma run it, I ain't runnin' out of money
I keep it one hunnid
Lol to the bank, to you niggas its not funny
G Money got me sippin' hard, ayy
With the offwhite jeans on me
I asked bro what time it is
He said its time to get some money
