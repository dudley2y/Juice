Nah, lean
Good drank, fuck-nigga, uh
999

Woah, huh, cookin' with the pots all on the stove
Wockhardt in my soda, take me home
Twelve be tryna tap in on my phone
That's why me and my niggas speak in codes
Had a show up in Alaska, it was super cold
Bought a Moncler for it, I ain't even put it on
Had a show up in Chicago, I'm back home
Got the same old thots tryna blow up my phone

Like, "Can I get some tickets?" Bitch, no
"Come and get your dick licked," bitch, no
"Juice WRLD, you trippin'," I know
Where was y'all when I had my back to the wall?
I done glowed up, pourin' fours up
In the 'Rari doin' doughnuts, yeah
80K a show, 100K, I'll put a verse on there
Got my polе tucked, niggas slow up
Keep playin', you gon' die in herе
Amiri low-cut, cost four bucks
Young, rich nigga, I'm fly in here

Cookin' with the pots all on the stove
Wockhardt in my soda, take me home
Twelve be tryna tap in on my phone
That's why me and my niggas speak in codes
Had a show up in Alaska, it was super cold
Bought a Moncler for it, I ain't even put it on (Ya dig?)
Had a show up in Chicago, I'm back home
Got the same old thots tryna blow up my phone

Them the same old thots from my old block
Choppa get to singing, shit like O' Block
Three hundred in that round, just like O' Block
But I be with No Limit, we got them poles tucked
Swervo in a Bentley truck, goin' brazy
Me, I'm in a Lamborghini on the daily
Hollywood with a bunch of savages from Chi-town
Livin' lavish, couldn't do this shit in my town
Had to take off, had to go with my heart, its a pray or pay off
40 take your face off, if you get in the way of the dreams I'm chasin'
Before I'm end this song, I'm sayin' RIP to my bro
Those who  had the AR, he used to let that bitch off

Cookin' with the pots all on the stove
Wockhardt in my soda, take me home
Twelve be tryna tap in on my phone (Twelve bitch)
That's why me and my niggas speak in codes
Had a show up in Alaska, it was super cold (Yeah)
Bought a Moncler for it, I ain't even put it on (Ya dig?)
Had a show up in Chicago, I'm back home (Let's go)
Got the same old thots tryna blow up my phone (Let's go)
