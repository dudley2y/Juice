Ayy, Chris, bruh
This one of those songs you gotta just bust on
You know how them niggas back in the day, they used to, "Left, right, left"
If we get in a shootout, I'ma keep that K like a Russian
(Got it on Smash)
(It goes, "Left, right, left, take yo' breath")
I say, "G-Money just bought a pound of the Gushers, we’ve been smokin' exotic product" (Bitch)
(My shit make all them sounds, fuck you talkin' 'bout)

I grip the K like a Russian (Okay, yeah)
Quarterback sack, bitch I'm rushing (Okay, yeah)
Count up the cash in American, English, Spanish, Chinese and Russian (Oh yeah)
I'm at yo' head like concussion
She give me head like concussion
Love when she suck with her tongue and she put it in her throat like a mo'fuckin' cushion
Why police look at me crooked? (Why?)
I'm a young nigga gettin' that money, that's why
Look at they eyes just be crooked (Why?)
All these bitches be ugly, them beady-ass eyes
You gettin' jewelry taken
You claim that you totin', how come you ain't let that bitch fly?
I never get jewelry taken
My bitch'll shoot you in the face if you think about tryin'

My money make me a giant, oh
I hit 'em like Fee-Fi-Fo, yeah
If I go broke, I'ma take his dough, rob him for his dough, yeah
These niggas asking me where I come from
I come from the city where it's colder (Let's go)
Always gotta look over your shoulder (Uh)
Never know when someone wanna smoke ya (Grrah)
Man down, look, who is the man now?
Can't wait till the drugs touch down
Me and Lotti, Max finna have a Perc-go-round
Chris lying saying he puttin' them down
Know he pop Percs every time they around (Lyin' ass nigga)
And when that lean around, Lotti say it make her frown (I ain't tryna make you frown)
I'm a different person when I'm off of the pour up
Catch a body and I won't even know it
I make a song off the purple, I'm focused
Make an album, shit it out, hocus pocus
Catch him lackin', I'ma shoot in the open
Like a cigarillo, bitch I'ma smoke him
L-O-L, all of these niggas be jokin'
They may just make me kill them, they keep provokin'

I grip the K like a Russian (Okay, yeah)
Quarterback sack, bitch I'm rushing (Okay, yeah)
Count up the cash in American, English, Spanish, Chinese and Russian (Oh yeah)
I'm at yo' head like concussion
She give me head like concussion
Love when she suck with her tongue and she put it in her throat like a mo'fuckin' cushion
Why police look at me crooked? (Why?)
I'm a young nigga gettin' that money, that's why
Look at they eyes just be crooked (Why?)
All these bitches be ugly, them beady-ass eyes
You gettin' jewelry taken
You claim that you totin', how come you ain't let that bitch fly?
I never get jewelry taken
My bitch'll shoot you in the face if you think about tryin'

March on the beat like a mo'fuckin' sergeant
That .40 on me, shoot like I'm from the squadron
Moncler on the moon boots, I'm not from this planet
I promise to God, I'm a mo'fuckin' martian
Call me Juice WRLD the martian, I'm Marvin the Martian
I'm super like Marvel, my drip is so marvelous
Dropped the Death Race For Love, it sold so much the first week
That shit goin' harder than granite and marbles
It may just go platinum on niggas that haven't gone gold in a minute, these niggas been slippin'
Pussy remind me of pussy niggas, I kill pussy with dick, pussy niggas with Smith &
I don't got time for these rookie niggas, yeah, I know I'm a rookie, far from a beginner
I used to smoke purple but that shit got old, now I smoke Gelato, Biscotti, I'm pimpin', oh yeah
That nigga trippin', gon' and get rid of him
These niggas really ain't rappers, they don't got no rhythm, they hide behind 808s and all the synths
I'm yo' father, Darth Vader, red beam, I'm the Sith
Heard yo' lil' bitch got herpes, don't think that I'm kiddin'
Why you think she ain't fuck you or suck you in a minute?
Tried to give it to me, bitch, I'm taken, you trippin'

I grip the K like a Russian (Okay, yeah)
Quarterback sack, bitch I'm rushing (Okay, yeah)
Count up the cash in American, English, Spanish, Chinese and Russian (Oh yeah)
I'm at yo' head like concussion
She give me head like concussion
Love when she suck with her tongue and she put it in her throat like a mo'fuckin' cushion
Why police look at me crooked? (Why?)
I'm a young nigga gettin' that money, that's why
Look at they eyes just be crooked (Why?)
All these bitches be ugly, them beady-ass eyes
You gettin' jewelry taken
You claim that you totin', how come you ain't let that bitch fly?
I never get jewelry taken
My bitch'll shoot you in the face if you think about tryin'

I don't even gotta shoot
My bitch'll shoot you in the face (Got it on Smash)
Then she shoot your bitch in the face
Then we shoot your bitch in the face
Then we may go out for a date
After shootin' you in the face
