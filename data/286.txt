Shout to young Cardo, shout out to Cardo
Cardo got wings
Uh

Oh, no, no
Too much on my mind feel like I'm 'bout to overload
Life's too hard, I take the easy way and overdose
Too many ups and downs, this a rollercoast'
I was born to drown, I was born hell-bound
My back to the world as it all burns down
Yeah, my heart was good, until I found out
Ain't no such thing as good anymore

Being optimistic is a waste of time, uh
One thing about time, you ain't wasting mine
Ain't no saving me, I know my heart cold
Blame it on the weather and the narcos
Take my breath, take my heart, take my soul, nothing left
I got cash, but I can't take that with me after death
You can't tell, bitch, I'm stressed, I been feeling like a mess
I been feeling like a wreck, 911, I'm in distress
There's a hole in my chest
There ain't nothing left
But I'll try my best, to be the best, uh

Oh, no, no
Too much on my mind feel like I'm 'bout to overload
Life's too hard, I take the easy way and overdose
Too many ups and downs, this a rollercoast'
I was born to drown, I was born hell-bound
My back to the world as it all burns down
Yeah, my heart was good, until I found out
Ain't no such thing as good anymore
