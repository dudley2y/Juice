{Intro}
We was just talkin' 'bout some shit, yeah
Girl, you don't, you don't, you don't
Yeah, you don't, you don't, you don't

{Chorus}
You don’t know me like you think you know me
Say you love me baby girl then show me
Arguments, all you do is blow me
But when you leave I'm so fucking lonely
{Verse 1}
I walk, walk away, away from all my problems
I look, look at you, look at you to solve them
Now I see, now I see that is the problem
Cold dependence, not independent
Now I see, now I see, I see through the darkness
Climbing out of the hole which I fall in
Finding peace in a world full of sorrow
I'll try, I'll try
{Pre-Chorus}
Love live let her go
Fuck that, hold her close
Do I get high off her love?
Or just percy overdose
All of those options are tempting
Still wish we were never ending
{Chorus}
You don’t know me like you think you know me
Say you love me baby girl then show me
Arguments, all you do is blow me
But when you leave I'm so fucking lonely
You don’t know me like you think you know me
Say you love me baby girl then show me
Arguments, all you do is blow me
But when you leave I'm so fucking lonely
{Post-Chorus}
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This ain't heaven, it's hell with a smile
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll sit down, this may take a while
{Verse 2}
Hold my hand yeah, yeah, yeah
And don't give up on us
Got a fire a desire, I got love fever
Let us dance yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the devil in a touch
You’re the one with all the fire
{Pre-Chorus}
Love live let her go
Fuck that, hold her close
Do I get high off her love?
Or just percy overdose
All of those options are tempting
Still wish we were never ending
{Chorus}
You don’t know me like you think you know me
Say you love me baby girl then show me
Arguments, all you do is blow me
But when you leave I'm so fucking lonely
You don’t know me like you think you know me
Say you love me baby girl then show me
Arguments, all you do is blow me
But when you leave I'm so fucking lonely
{Post-Chorus}
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This ain't heaven, it's hell with a smile
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll sit down, this may take a while
