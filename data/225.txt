You ain't safe by me, I will play you

All the way, all the way, all the way there
I don't play, I don't play, I don't play fair
I'm away, in my ways, and I stay there
Get my way, get my way, with my ways, yeah
All the way, all the way, all the way there
I don't play, I don't play, I don't play fair
I'm away, in my ways, and I stay there
Get my way, get my way, with my ways, yeah

Get away from me, get away, ooh
You ain't safe by me, I will play you
If your man bring you 'round, I will take you
Take you to the condo to taste you
Next day, I replace you
Heartbreak, I will waste you
Everything feeling so unstable
Don't you love it when I turn the tables

All the way there
I don't play fair
You ain't safe by me, I will play you
