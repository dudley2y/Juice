Honorable Court

Missed the days I woke up, you were next to me (Yeah)
Get a quick reply when you be textin' me (Yeah)
And you always keep it real, don't gotta flex to me (Yeah)
So no matter where I go, I'll always need you by my side
Yeah, you're down to ride, Bonnie and Clyde
If a nigga try to take you, straight homicide
That's on my life, just be my wife

Let me come and sweep you right up off your feet (Ayy)
I'm so used to sadness, that shit follows me (Ayy)
Happiness you bring, baby, be my queen
Yeah, I know these demons comin' after me (Ayy)
With you in my arms, I ain't worried bout a thing
Can't get enough of your kisses, baby, I miss it
When I'm around you I fit in, usually feel like a misfit
I know we just met, but baby, this is different
You're so self-sufficient, choke you like submissive (Ayy)
Baby, if I said it, then I fuckin' meant it (Ayy)
I will never treat you bad like these other niggas (Ayy)

Let me show you something you ain't ever seen (Ayy)
Got me cuffed up like a felony (Ayy)
Hit it from the back, that shit heavenly (Ayy)
Now we in the groove like the '70s (Ayy)
Won't take no call, still pickin' up your phone calls
Baby, I'm a beast
Girl, you got me in a world that's drama free
All these other hoes, they be wanna-be's
I don't wanna be with nobody except you, you, you
