My bros catching body bags
Yeah, yeah, um, ah
(Wheezy outta here)

Let's go, where the fuck the molly at?
Woah, time to catch a body bag
My bros down to catch a body bag
My bros down to catch a body bag
Woah, where the fuck the molly at?
Oh, time to catch a body bag
My bros down to catch a body bag
My bros down to catch a body bag

Uh, keep it in the stash box
My bros known to make them Glocks pop
My bros known to keep the blocks hot
My bros known to ring the gun shots, grrah
Man down, hospital bed, he done, ah
Repeat, did the same shit, huh, next week, huh
Turn the party to a track meet, yeah
Who the tough guy now? It's me
Who the tough guy now? It's me
You ain't know I had my thing with me
You ain't know I was known to let it bang on the scene
Now you bleed, bleed, bleed (Now you)
Now it's rest in peace, peace, peace
