Wheezy outta here

I love codeine, but I got to let go
She know she too special
Red, sometimes purple
Eyes gettin' heavy
I love codeine, I don’t wanna let go
She know she too special
That's one of them relationships you want to last forever
But you know it's not gon’ last past the second
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, uh

Double me up, double my cup
Pour that shit up, I need some more
Maybe like three, cups, maybe four
Fuck on that bitch, she from the stu'
I don't know her name but she came
And she love my tunes
Fuckin' that bitch in the back of the room
I see many things, I'm off of the shrooms
Damn, I'm getting sidetracked back to the lean
Wockhardt has a beautiful feeling
Remember we was doing this with the Xans
Now I'm doing it with styrofoam in my hand
Hi-Tech has a beautiful feeling
I'm stressed, I need to numb my feelings
Yup, that’s what the lean’s for
I already poured a couple cups
I think I need a couple more
I swear to God, this shit the worst
If I don't have it, these withdrawals put my soul into the dirt
If I don’t have it, I'll get pissed
And then my stomach start to hurt

I love codeine, but I got to let go
She know she too special
Red, sometimes purple
Eyes gettin' heavy
I love codeine, I don't wanna let go
She know she too special
That’s one of them relationships you want to last forever
But you know it's not gon' last past the second
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, uh
