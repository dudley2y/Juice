Wheezy outta here

Yeah
I get higher than the murder rate (Huh, yeah)
Shut the fuck up, I can't concentrate (Huh, shit, yeah)
If he try me today, he gon' die today
On my knees, I been praying for brighter days
Got the meter assist, shot a fade away (Hoo, shit, yeah)
I be up working all night and day
Your bitch swallow my dick, said she proud of me
No one knew me, now bitches surrounding me
Ain't no new me, I won't ever change, oh
All my niggas, they really stay down for me
Double R, SUV, and a Range Rove'
I'ma pull off, I'm doing a high speed

Weezy F made it, I'm finna kill it, go ahead and bury it
I got my gun, I'ma Mariah Carey it
I love the money so much, I'ma marry it
Don't know how to act, I feel like a barbarian
He don't want beef, that nigga vegetarian
Gun with a silencer, like a librarian
I be the reason all these bitches staring
She swallow my kids, not good at parenting
Pay me a hundred-fifty for appearances
I got a Lamborghini from the dealership
If I don't buy a car, I put it on my wrist (Gleam, gleam)
Rocking red, just like Popovich
Shooting like Stockton, ain't nobody stopping it
They pocket watching, ain't nobody robbin' this
Give him the MAC-11 with the cooling kit (Ooh-ooh)
My niggas coming for you (Ooh)
My niggas coming for you (Ooh)
Ain't no telling what they gon' do
Catch you at the red light, pull up, vroom
She ride my dick like a witch on a broom
When he walked in, we smell bitch in the room
Ayy, shoot that dude
Brah-brah-brah coming out that tool

Yeah
I get higher than the murder rate (Huh, yeah)
Shut the fuck up, I can't concentrate (Huh, shit, yeah)
If he try me today, he gon' die today
On my knees, I been praying for brighter days
Got the meter assist, shot a fade away (Hoo, shit, yeah)
I be up working all night and day
Your bitch swallow my dick, said she proud of me
No one knew me, now bitches surrounding me
Ain't no new me I won't ever change, oh
All my niggas, they really stay down for me
Double R, SUV and a Range Rove'
I'ma pull off, I'm doing a high speed
