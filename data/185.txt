Tell me what's it like to fall in love
I’ve been shopping at the Drugs-R-Us
No outlet, but the plugs are us
Too busy getting too fucked up
Tell me what's it like to fall in love
I've been shopping at the Drugs-R-Us
No outlet, but the plugs are us
Too busy getting too fucked up

Too much Oxy in my body, I don’t know if I can take it
Everything is in slow motion, like I'm stuck inside the matrix
I treat my demons like they blunts, I just roll them up and face 'em
Underground railroad drugs got me like a slaver
Run away from my insecurities, I feel evasive
Sometimes I look at my past, and wish that I could just erase it
I don't fuck with that nigga in the mirror, I feel like I'm racist
It's a drill off the pills, major pain, when the pain hit
Relapse, now I'm in a daze, this shit feel amazing
Been high for a couple days, this shit really brazy
Take the pills a couple ways, snort it, don't be basic
And that’s bad advice, but I know that you gonna take it

Bad conscience taking over on the daily
I blame it on myself, and the decisions that I’m making
From taking too much to dating an evil lady
I put myself in Hell

Too busy getting too fucked up
Tell me what's it like to fall in love
I've been shopping at the Drugs-R-Us
No outlet, but the plugs are us
Too busy getting too fucked up

Too busy running through my head
Contemplating what I should've said
Contemplating what I should’ve did
Been like this since I was a little kid
Molly popping feel like Little Bill
Chase thrills 'till my face go numb, numb
Uh, life's a bitch, I'ma gonna make mine cum
Like, sit on my face with it, uh-huh
Time is precious, can't afford to waste it uh-uh
But every day I'm getting wasted, uh-huh
Imagine your hourglass breaking, uh-huh
That's what happens when you take the drugs too far
Take 'em too far

Tell me what's it like to fall in love
