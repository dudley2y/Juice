Mhm
I mean I can barley talk uh
Oh these words I'm intricate
But when I speak to 'em I'm a little illiterate
I'm ballin' on these hoes best believe I'ma get it
I'm trynna get that rich money like I'm Ellen DeGeneres

I'm killing it, killing it, uh, I'ma hit a lick
Like I'm licking the clitoris, uh
I'ma keep on killing, drilling, full of adrenaline, uh
I feel like a villain, Dragon Ball, I'm like Krillin or some'in'
I'ma get this cash, best believe that I'm spendin' it
Then I'm getting it back
Bobby Brown up in the trap, from the way I'm spitting this crack
Nigga, to be exact my flow is off of the map
Every time that I spit all these niggas toppin' they hats
Sayin' I am the man again
Nigga's faking it, they mannequins
Walk in the sky like I'm Anakin
Gucci all on my flannel
People thinking they understand but they really can't comprehend
I'm that TV station, you can't reach the channel
Really, really these niggas are just too silly
I'm Meek Milly, what flow is how I pop a wheelie
Run through the six, like woes
I fuck with Drizzy, every song Drake hop on, he bound to get busy
Every song that Juice hop on is bound to get icky
Fuck the beat until it cums so I'm leaving it sticky
(Threesomes)
Niggas can't fuck with me, you know that I beat 'em
Ice on my wrist, I finna freeze 'em
Life is a bitch, fuck with me, she'll leave ya
I'm ballin' out, every day I'm a hit 'em
Got my hand on my heater
They say they don't fuck with me
Shit, I don't fuck with me either
We one of the same people
Nah, we different
I'm at the top and you at the bottom
It's a Magnum in my pocket, a gun
Also a condom, niggas thinkin' it snakes, but I see the anaconda
Really, I'm just gonna sing this shit like it's an opera
(Free 21 Savage)
Free 21 Savage, they tryna send him back to UK
He livin' lavish, he over here gettin' too payed
They can't manage, they wanna see a nigga fail
That's how they planned it (He's on fire)
But I'ma continue to go nuts like Planters
Listenin' to Red Opps, 21, he spazzin'
And me, I got fire, I feel like a dragon
I'm flying on this beat like a carpet, Aladdin
I'm out of space, on Saturn, I'm spitting these flows
You know how it is, I rap a little to switch up the flow
This shit for the kids, I do it for the people back home
That didn't believe, I'm finna take a shit in they house
(London City)
And then I'ma leave
You said London?
We get it bustin' up in London, like a concussion
Off of the top, the way I run it, explode like combustion
You ain't talking money, then fuck it
That's the end of discussion, man (Perfect)
I can't believe what I'm saying
(Cherries and oranges)
I can't believe what I'm saying, you know this shit ain't a plan, huh
Ay, I'm at your door, warning ya, huh
Banana clip, I aim at your orange and shit
Really, I'm just at your fuckin' cabinet like a cabbage patch
I ain't with the battle rap
But if I wanted I could battle rap any battle rapper, and body him
Put him in a pill and pop him like he was Molly and
(Cardi B)
Ayy, Cardi B she got them hits too
Cardi B, she that bitch too, Cardi B and she rich too
I'm tryna get Cardi B rich, you feel me fool?
Man, I got the money in my pocket though, a couple in my wallet
With some millions in my face, I dare a nigga try to stop it
Please don't get out of pocket, we get the pop and the knockin's
I remember bein' in Illinois's Robin and Robin
'Fore Robins couldn't afford it

Now I'm payin' my mortgage
I just bought my mom a car so you know that she gorgeous
Pull up on 'em, I'm ballin', shooting I'm feeling like Spartan'
Matter of fact, I'm Michael Jordan
From the free throw, I been soaring, ya dig?
