Huh, huh
I don't even know that nigga
Uh, ya dig?
Really wanna go on a safari
Won't embarrass myself, ooh I look like safari
Run up that shit fried, that shit dead, calamari
Vlone by my lonely, bitch, I'm feelin' like I'm Bari
Ayy, Rvssian
(Uh)

Better simmer down (Uh), simmer down
Better simmer down (Uh), simmer down
Better simmer down (Uh), simmer down
Better simmer down (Uh), simmer down
Lurkin' with the semi now, semi now
Casualties too many now, too many to count
Better simmer down (Uh), simmer down
Better simmer down (Uh), simmer down

Too piped up, had to mellow out
Ballin' on these niggas like Carmelo now
Play the block, kinda like a cello wow
BlocBoy shooting out the roof, how
Like, shoot, my, boo
Foreign, like, my, coupe
Fat, ass, yes, juice
Diamonds, crystals, I love jewels
Ws, I'm in the W
No I can't lose, I don't pity the fool
So I won't pity you, I won't pity you
