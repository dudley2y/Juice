Off a couple beans (What else?)
Maybe a cup of lean (What else?)
Beat the Sprite up (What else?)
Gonna make it bleed (What else?)
I bought one thing (What else?)
Okay, maybe a couple of things (What else?)
Uh, Saks Fifth (What else?)
Then I hit double G (What else?)
Then I hit Louis V (What else?)

Bitch, I'm so important
These Diors imported
Nigga, I could pay your mortgage
Fuck it, I'ma spend that shit on your daughter
She calling me daddy, she probably got dad issues
You should be a better father
Damn, zooming in a go-kart
Love lean, but I really hate pop
Love pop, but I really love rock
Love peace, but I really love Glocks
These niggas must love head-shots
Think it's sweet 'cause the sad songs out
Took two W's rolling off an E, that's a God damn smack-down
I don't know, I think I run it right now
Real shit, be a hundred right now
Nineteen years old, number nine on the Billboard, nigga like how?
I'ma be number one next week, trust me
Won't fuck your bitch 'cause I heard that she musty
Hundred round drum on the choppa, it's bustin'
Word to your mom, that bitch crusty
Shit on a fuck ass nigga then flush it
AK in the back of the car like a Russian
These niggas be talkin' to narcs or somethin'
How the fuck else my homie get busted?
Gonna free my nigga outta the dungeon
When he get out, nigga, it's bustin'
Run up bands, gain clout
Smoke out the pound, I'm on the clouds

First you get the baking soda then you get the water
Nigga fuck with my moolah, then he gettin' slaughtered
If you pussy then you pussy (Then you pussy), ain't no getting harder
I put that shit on my mom, speaking of moms I could fuck your mom
Talkin' that shit, get the firearm
They'll be in your crib like, "Fuck your moms"
Kill everybody but your mom
Yeah, I just said it, yeah, so I meant it, yeah
That nigga trippin', catch him slippin', we gon' get him, yeah
And she screamin', "Ricky"
Thick-ass bitch tryna get a lap dance screamin', "Nicki"
Aight I'm done for now, have y'all niggas had enough?
I'm a real nigga, I ain't with that talkin' tough
Fuck with us, we call your bluff
