Got a new 9 that'll leave your mouth wide
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire
Before I leave the crib, I pray to God I won't die
I know it's hard to kill me but I know they gon' try
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline
Get your own business and get out mine
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time
Watch them niggas around you, they playin' both sides

Boy your gang ain't your gang and your homies, not your homies
Run it up, get that sack, but do that shit right by your lonely
Choppa hit him with a force like I'm Obi-Wan Kenobi
Don't need no court to use my torch, I've been shootin' like I'm Kobe
I don't need nobody, I just need your body, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm gon' catch a body if you fuck with my money, ayy, ayy, ayy
Mixin' them narcotics turned me to a zombie
Ape with a nigga, Harambe
Pull up on a nigga, no talkin'
Leave a nigga leakin', no faucet
Stand up to the opps, never back down
He'll get beat with the belt like it's SmackDown
Studio jugg life trap house, crack cocaine my track outs
Up late night like owls, Backwoods smokin' on whiteouts
I got the lean on me right now, got a gun with a beam on me right now

Got a new 9 that'll leave your mouth wide
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire
Before I leave the crib, I pray to God I won't die
I know it's hard to kill me but I know they gon' try
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline
Get your own business and get out mine
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time
Watch them niggas around you, they playin' both sides
