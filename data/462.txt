Brand new bag, runnin'
You know it's Mitch Mula

I just got a brand new bag, runnin'
Count up cash, runnin'
That's your ass dummy
That's your ass, dummy
I just got a brand new bag, runnin'
Count that cash, runnin'
Pop them tags or somethin'
Shake that ass or somethin'
I just got a Goyard bag
Put 20K in the Goyard bag
Keep a mini-AK in the Goyard bag
When I leave for L.A., I don't ever come back
Still take my Goyard bag
Put 20K in the Goyard bag
I met this bitch from Georgia, she was gorgeous
So I fucked her in the morning, till the morning
I been balling, Michael Jordan, Kyrie Irving
Off the Bourbon in the 'burbs, swervin' in Suburban
I ball like Julius Erving, I deserve it
I see snakes in the grass, but it's fuck a serpent, ayy
She left me for my brother, guess I fucked a serpent, ayy
Talking down to me are you or are you certain, ayy
Perkys in the lean, I'm a different person
I'm falling apart, yeah, I deserve it
I drunk drive all the time, yeah I stay swervin'
I feel like a pitcher cause I stay curvin'
I just got a brand new bag runnin'
Count up cash runnin'
That's your ass, dummy
That's your ass, dummy
