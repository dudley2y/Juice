That shit normal to me
Ain't no fairy tale
Demons tormenting me
Drugs help me sleep
I need strong fuck that weak shit
Lines of that ye got my stripes no Adidas
Percocet, codeine you know how I bleed (Ayy)
Rollin' off a bean, I'm a fuckin' fiend (Ayy)
I'm still in my feels I'm still in my feels (Ayy)
I see everything, I see everything

I can't feel emotion, going through the motions
I'ma pop this Perky, with this purple potion
She know that I'm rollin', but she still goin'
She know I'ma demon, had a god moment
All these niggas crazy thinkin' they can fuck with Juice
Just cause you fuck with me, don't mean I fuck with you
That's your bitch cool, she just fucked my crew
Ayy, Bape stars, they was on my shoes
That's ya homeboy, he just made the news
He so basic, we just took his truce
Don't get shit confused, bitch I rock Dior
Ten toes big pole at my front door
Ayy, ayy, she want all of me
Come and play my sport, baby come and ball for me
Hit my storage, yeah baby call for me
I need more lean, fake a cough for me (Ha, ha, ha)

Tell that bitch I need a new prescription for your coughing shit
Got the bitch on the phone with the doctor
Ayy, woah, ayy

I'm in hell lie in hell
That shit normal more to me
Ain't no fairy tale
Demons tormenting me
Drugs help me sleep
I need strong fuck that weak shit
Lines of that ye got my stripes no Adidas
Percocet, codeine you know how I bleed (Ayy)
Rollin' off a bean I'm a fuckin' fiend (Ayy)
I'm still in my feels I'm still in my feels (Ayy)
I see everything, I see everything

Yeah, yesterday I was just up in my feels
Now, I just pour up the lean
Drippin' designer jeans
B's VLONE and B's on the sleeve
I might just pop me a Tesla pill
But I just fuck with Supreme
Finesse the plug right out his packs
No, you can't get that shit back
Ayy, ayy
These bitches, they fuckin' for free
I don't do nothin' for free
Even my freestyles ain't free
Me and Juice up on a track
That mean it's racks on racks
Feel like yesterday, we was just broke
Now we just dreamin' on stacks
Had a little bitch finesse on me
You wasn't there when I poured up a three
Dropped out of school, like I had something to prove
Road runnin', when I cooked up with Juice
We official, and I'm telling the truth
Bad bitches, and they feeling the crew
Doing anything, just for the crew
Getting wild, and them bitches get dirty
Last year, nobody had heard of me
Had to dip, and that bitch had heard me
Fucked a bitch now I'm charged like a battery
Yeah, uh
I ain't ever had this feelin' here before
I'm off a Perc and some lean, I need some more
Yeah, some more
Gang
Uh, yeah you knew I was gonna throw some shit like this though
On slime

I'm in hell lie in hell
That shit normal more to me
Ain't no fairy tale
Demons tormenting me
Drugs help me sleep
I need strong fuck that weak shit
Lines of that ye got my stripes no Adidas
Percocet, codeine you know how I bleed (Ayy)
Rollin' off a bean I'm a fuckin' fiend (Ayy)
I'm still in my feels I'm still in my feels (Ayy)
I see everything, I see everything

I see everything, I see everything
