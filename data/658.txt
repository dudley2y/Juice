I got an army, bitch, an army (ATL Jacob)
Hit the army, hit the army
Yeah, army
Uh, cool

You got a few niggas? I got an army
You got a few guns? We got an armory
I'm with them bool niggas, they be booling
But if you fuck up once, chopper oozing
I'm a cool nigga, with the k shit, I've always been a cool nigga
By the way, to all them niggas I went to school with
How do it taste?
You workin' a nine to five, I'm finna get a mansion by the lake, hey

Yeah, wolves in my backyard
House in the forest
Chopper in the backseat
Make him run like Gump, nigga, Forest
In the DeLorean, floor it
I'll be with barbarians but she ignores it
I love my killers just like my mama love me
I catch a body for them just like they do for me
Real, real, real, uh
Real, real, real, uh
Real, real, real, uh
Real, real
Zoomin' in that spaceship, shoutout NASA
Change like slavery, shoutout massah
Fuck that college shit won't graduate with my masters
So many beams on this Glock, you thought it was a blaster
Blazer tech, hollow-tips, hit him, hit him
Yeah, hit a nigga in the head, we were laughing as he bled
Big ass guns, ain't no little, little
Slidin' on your cousin', we saw him ridin' on a bicycle

You got a few niggas? I got an army
You got a few guns? We got an armory
I'm with them bool niggas, they be booling
But if you fuck up once, chopper oozing
I'm a cool nigga, with the k shit, I've always been a cool nigga
By the way, to all them niggas I went to school with
How do it taste?
