It's called codeine, mix it
Bitch, I'll save you later
That bitch save 
Don't go Major Lazer, haha
 really strong, ya dig?
Ay, I'm a player
Got a brand new gun, it got a major laser
I took her to my lair, in the Himalayas, yeah

I took her to my lair, in the Himalayas
Her boyfriend hatin' on me, got a Glock with a laser
Ain't worried 'bout a God damn thing, I'm all about the paper
I'ma do my God damn thing, fuck all of them haters
Your momma found out you was suckin', she like, "Jesus, save her," hmm
I may fuck that bitch, but I won't never save her, hmm
Pussy so good, damn near had to save it, hmm
Just so my lil' thot can eat her out later, hmm

Can't organize my thoughts, don't need no note paper
Off the dome shit, it's more creative anyway
You late to the party, happy belated
And if you want smoke, leave you cremated any day
Put the bullet holes, in his windshield
Even if I'm havin' a bad day, I win still
Wake up, pray to God, even though that I sin still
Devil weighin' on my shoulders, like an anvil
Perky got a nigga itchin', uh, anthill
Fuck that bitch then put her on my ad-libs
You happy fake, bitch, I'm mad real
Make that choppa masturbate, like a porn film

I took her to my lair, in the Himalayas
Her boyfriend hatin' on me, got a Glock with a laser
Ain't worried 'bout a God damn thing, I'm all about the paper
I'ma do my God damn thing, fuck all of them haters
Your momma found out you was suckin', she like, "Jesus, save her," hmm
I may fuck that bitch, but I won't never save her, hmm
Pussy so good, damn near had to save it, hmm
Just so my lil' thot can eat her out later, hmm
