On God, you hear him?
You know how I'm bleedin’ (You know how I'm bleeding)
VLONE Demons (VLONE in the building)
She ain't bout my demons (She ain’t bout my demons)
She up on my semen (VLONE)

Rolling up them VLONE drugs (What's up?)
Bari hit my phone we some VLONE thugs (What's up, what's up?)
We exposing fake VLONE thugs (What's up?)
.45 loaded with the VLONE slugs (What's up, what's up?)
Sippin' syrup, Bae I’m tryna slow up (What’s up?)
Perc pop, won't stop, I don’t throw up (What's up, what's up, what's up?)
We don’t know ya', but ya' know us (What's up, what's up, what's up?)
You can call us young VLONE thugs (Young VLONE thugs)

Knuck if you, buck if you
I'm known to face fuck issues, I'm cold, igloo
My wrist got the ice drizzle, two tone issue
Please don't touch my Raf unless you want to feel this pistol
Sign you like an autograph, hollow tips give you initials
Me and Bari sit back and laugh, count to the cash, no competition
W, W, W, W, W, huh, repetition
I cannot stop winning, had to work for it, wasn't given
Now the bad hoes hit our phone, they say that the drinks on us
Only if you tryna fuck on me, what's up?
Young rich niggas that's tryna have fun
Still not for nothing, I'm a VLONE thug

I'm a VLONE thug (I'm a VLONE thug)
I'm a VLONE thug
Ayy, let's go, huh

Rolling up them VLONE drugs (What's up?)
Bari hit my phone we some VLONE thugs (What's up, what's up?)
We exposing fake VLONE thugs (What's up?)
.45 loaded with the VLONE slugs (What's up, what's up?)
Sippin' syrup, Bae I'm tryna slow up (What's up?)
