Look me in my eyes (Yeah), look me in my eyes
Think I'm a mean guy (Yeah), I'm not surprised
Shit, I must be nice (Yeah), if I'm by your side
Fireflies, we ignite

Uh, half of the time we argue, don't know what we fighting 'bout
But every time I tell you I love you, I know what I'm talking 'bout
I know I fuck up sometimes but please don't count me out
When I said forever, I meant it, I'll follow you like a cloud
Raining down, with my tears, if you frown
You're my queen, all around
Our time is forever, it'll never run out
I'm acting up, you packing up
I mean it when I say, "I'm sorry, love"
Also mean it when I say forever love
I get high off of you, my forever drug
Don't need a plug, don't need a plug
'Cause she the plug, yeah, she the plug, yeah
She the one, she can have my son if she want it
She can even hold my gun if she want it
She ain't gotta leave in the morning
All these other hoes leave in the morning
And if her ex man come, I'ma make a nigga bleed in the morning
Uh, .223s to the stomach, uh
Fuck some of your love 'cause I want it all
Whenever you on my mind, I'm having a ball

Look me in my eyes (Yeah), look me in my eyes
Think I'm a mean guy (Yeah), I'm not surprised
Shit, I must be nice (Yeah), if I'm by your side
Fireflies, we ignite
Look me in my eyes (Yeah), look me in my eyes
Think I'm a mean guy (Yeah), I'm not surprised
Shit, I must be nice (Yeah), if I'm by your side
Fireflies, we ignite
