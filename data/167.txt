(She an angel with them devil horns, yeah)
(Devil horns, yeah)

She an angel with them devil horns, yeah
Devil horns, yeah, devil horns, yeah
Never met a girl like this before, yeah
This before, yeah, this before, yeah
She put my belongings at the door, yeah
At the door, yeah, at the door, yeah
Close the coffin, put it in a morgue, yeah
In a morgue, yeah, in a morgue, yeah, yeah

She was like the girls from the movies
Everybody sayin' she gon' use me
She really had me looking like a fool, who am I fooling?
She was way more than a groupie
Pretty like a fresh pair of Gucci's
She give me brain and she smoke on them loosies, so loosely
I told her nothing ever really moves me
So I don't know why she got me up in my feelings
And I don't know if it's agony that I'm feeling
But I'm feeling

Na na na, na na na na
I regret everything I said
Drink my sorrows and regrets away, away

She an angel with them devil horns, yeah
Devil horns, yeah, devil horns, yeah
Never met a girl like this before, yeah
This before, yeah, this before, yeah
She put my belongings at the door, yeah
At the door, yeah, at the door, yeah
Close the coffin, put it in a morgue, yeah
In a morgue, yeah, in a morgue, yeah, yeah

As the liquor kicks in, she's swimmin' through my head
Her hands in my dreads, yeah
Fill me up with dread
Watch as she goes, as I come too close
To my overdose, she won't hold me close
If she does the most, yeah, I mean the most
Of the pills and the Henny, I ain't living on my own

Na na na na (No), na na na na (Yeah)
Na na na na (No), na na na na (No)
Na na na na (No), na na na na (Yeah)
Na na na na (No), na na na na (No)
Na na na, na na na na
I regret everything I said
Drink my sorrows and regrets away, away

She an angel with them devil horns, yeah
Devil horns, yeah, devil horns, yeah
Never met a girl like this before, yeah
This before, yeah, this before, yeah
She put my belongings at the door, yeah
At the door, yeah, at the door, yeah
Close the coffin, put it in a morgue, yeah
In a morgue, yeah, in a morgue, yeah, yeah

Na na na na (No), na na na na (Yeah)
Na na na na (No), na na na na (No)
Na na na na (No), na na na na (Yeah)
Na na na na (No), na na na na (No)
