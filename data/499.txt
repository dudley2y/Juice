This one we surfin'? Surfs up, wave, uh-huh, ayy (808 Mafia)
808, 150 No Limit Gang
Triple nine, fuck what you claim

I'ma pull up in a Bentley, bitch ride me just like a ten speed
Got a .40 with 30s, the auto or semi, extended clip, I got plenty
I count rack after rack, put her in, I'ma slap
My gun just like a bitch, it's sittin' on my lap
I'm a rebel, play heavy metal in the trap
Got the red when I pop the phantom in the back (Yeah)

My money old, London bridge
She made me sick, swallow kids
Still wanna hate, hollow tips
Hop in the whip, Grand Theft Auto my clip
Suck my dick like a baby bottle, poppin' dick
Hit 'em with it like Ronda Rousey, but I win
All these niggas that heard about me, they be worried about me, they be really scary 'bout the kid
Givenchy my kicks, I'll never kick it wit' 'em
If you forgot the drip, Balenciaga denim
To a hood nigga, True Religion on the denim
And the polyester Versace on the linen
Fucked her rolled off the perkies, kitty, I'ma kill it
Bullets land on your face, it aimin' for a kiss
Diamonds shine like a star, Orion or Achilles
Sagittarius, horoscope on the semi

I'ma pull up in a Bentley, bitch ride me just like a ten speed
Got a .40 with 30s, the auto or semi, extended clip, I got plenty
I count rack after rack, put her in, I'ma slap
My gun just like a bitch, it's sittin' on my lap
I'm a rebel, play heavy metal in the trap
Got the red when I pop the phantom in the back (Yeah)

I pop the phantom, pop out
Everyday I keep my Glock out
I take your bitch to a cock-mouth, wanna see what her slot 'bout
Benjamin Franklin right now, I need Benjamin right now
Ruger nueve, got 'em breathin' heavy
I'm the motherfuckin' boss of the sauce, El Hefe

Tempted, money on my head, yeah

Pull up to your bitch house, say she gon' be right out
Backwood smoke, no White Owl, White Owl
He ain't got a gun so he say he tryna fight now
Momma said knock your lights out, lights out
I'm V.I.P in the club with the ice out
Two-hundred down, three dubs for the bling-blaow
I'm the type of nigga to get a TV show
Just to beat your ass, call me Jerry Springer now
Gucci shades on, I don't even see these hoes
Purple Rain like Prince, pour up 'till I pass out
After I smash, I'm doin the dash
It's back to the cash, I live on the cash route

Tempted, money on my head, yeah
(Tempted, money on my head, yeah)

I'ma pull up in a Bentley, bitch ride me just like a ten speed
Got a .40 with 30s, the auto or semi, extended clip, I got plenty
I count rack after rack, put her in, I'ma slap
My gun just like a bitch, it's sittin' on my lap
I'm a rebel, play heavy metal in the trap
Got the red when I pop the phantom in the back
