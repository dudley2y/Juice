Who am I? Bitch, who are you? Ayy
I just had to hit that light switch you feel me
Yuh, yuh, yuh, ayy, swooh, oh I got high for this one, ayy

With the gang, in my lane, boy I never change, ayy
I'm the same, I'm the same, I be with the gang, ayy
Pop a Xan just to ease the pain, ayy
Blow you down in your fucking game, wait, ayy
Who are you? Who the fuck are you? ayy
Tie the knot, with the Glock, like a fucking shoe, ayy
Boy I heard you got that pole, but you won't fucking shoot, ayy
I might kill you and your moms, I don't got shit to lose, ayy

I am lunatic, I go crazy with the stupidness
I'm a wild fucking hooligan
Yeah it's Juice let the Uzi spit
I might fuck a bitch then kick her out

Your bitch gon' know what the dick about
Your team gon' know what my clip about

Came with the Ruger again
Boy you ain't got no damn shooters again, ayy

Now I ain't come to shoot the one, bitch
But I'm still shooting some shit, ayy
Boy I hate bitches, they just make assumptions
Making something, out of nothing, ayy
Now what sense do that make, ayy
I got this work, hard rock, earthquake
I whip the pot and then I make the earth shake, ayy
Should've never came here in the first place, ayy, ayy
Blow your candles out, happy birthday, ayy, ayy
I send shots to your fucking birthplace, ayy, ayy
In the studio cooling with Zayn
