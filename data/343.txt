Shoot for love
Like a gun in my hand
We can run up them bands, love
Pop me a Xan, on our way to France, love
Gun in my hand, we can run up them bands, love
Shoot for love
Shoot for love (Ohh, ohh, ohh)
Shoot for love

She an angel, she with the doves
I be high, I be off the drugs
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love?
Would you shoot for love?
Are you ready or not? Here I come
I done put my heart on the rocks so don't run
I done put my name on a bullet in my gun
I'ma shoot for love
Baby, are you ready or not? Here I come
I done put my heart in this song so don't run
Got my name in a bullet in my gun
I'ma shoot for love

Run babe, go and hide babe, just don't fall in in love
Run babe, go hide babe, just don't fall for love, in love
Are you ready or not? Here I come
I done put my heart on the rocks so don't run
I done put my name on a bullet in my gun
I'ma shoot for love
Baby, are you ready or not? Here I come
I done put my heart in this song so don't run
Got my name in a bullet in my gun
I'ma shoot for love
Shoot for love

Like a gun in my hand
We can run up them bands, love
Pop me a Xan, on our way to France, love
Gun in my hand, we can run up them bands, love
Shoot for love

Don't care if you're ready or not, 'cause I'm done
I done had enough of the pain, its not fun
Got my name in a bullet in my gun
I'ma kill for love
Don't care if you're ready or not, 'cause I'm done
I done had enough of the pain, its not fun
Got my name in a bullet in my gun
I'ma kill for love

Like a gun in my hand, we can run up them bands, love
Pop me a Xan, on our way to France, love
Gun in my hand
We can run up them bands, love
Shoot for love, shoot for love
