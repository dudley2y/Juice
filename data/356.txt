Codeine on me, I can't stop sipping it
Dick in her mouth, she can't stop licking it
If I see the nigga that slid on my homie

AP watch, won't stop glistening
Bullet hit your heart, nitroglycerin, uh

Ahead of my time, still in my prime
Paved the way for these niggas
Already fashionably late, so I won't wait for a nigga

We don't need you, but you need us, uh
