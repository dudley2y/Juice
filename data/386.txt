I ain't leave a clue on the scene
Close range so I got blood on my jeans, ayy
I shot a nigga in the club, double cup next to me I got his blood in my lean, uh
Choppa on me with a beam
Freddy Kreuger, show up in your dreams, uh
Things ain't not what they seem, uh
Shorty wanna ball on the team
Bitch I'm the best freestyle off the top
Got a bitch in the crib she been giving me top
Everyday bitch, I'ma count up the guap
Run up on me just like a zit, nigga get popped
I'm on the block with my niggas with choppas
I'm gettin' this money so I had to move
I'm in the ‘burbs with my mama
I bought her a mansion a house and a dog, it's cool
I don't give a fuck bout you just me, yeah, ayy
You know how it be, ayy
And
Wait
