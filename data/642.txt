Don't come no further
Don't come no further
Don't come noâ€”

Don't come no further, your name, I've heard of
Your love uncertain, heartbreak's in the air
Don't come no further, your name, I've heard of
Your love uncertain, heartbreak's in the air

Baby, you're insanity out of my mind
I've been through the wringer way, too many times
I heard you were talking 'bout me, spreading all the lies
Do you do that with all your other guys?
Murderin' me but I don't care, I still wanna see you in your underwear
I know that love is really scary, results may vary, but I'm all in
I know that I cheat, but bitch, who cares?
'Cause she gon' fuck me when you're not there
Remember when my heart was broken
Now it's open for bitches who still want a tear

Don't come no further, your name, I've heard of
Your love uncertain, heartbreak's in the air
Don't come no further, your name, I've heard of
Your love uncertain, heartbreak's in the air


Don't come no further, your name, I've heard of
Your love uncertain, heartbreak's in the air
Don't come no further, your name, I've heard of
Your love uncertain, heartbreak's in the air
