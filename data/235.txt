(Yeah)
I'm in love, I know what I'm into
Fell in love with you I ain't mean to
Jaw dropped to the floor first time I seen you
Said you were coming to L.A. couldn't wait to meet you
I'm obsessed for real, no pretend, ooh
Let's hit the bedroom, we got shit to tend to
I can feel my heart jump every time I see you
Got me feelin' cerebral, damn girl I need you

I'm so glad we ain't meet back in high school
Don't need to see what I've been through
Let me drown in your love, leave me consumed
Just don't walk me to my doom
I don't ever let nobody walk in my room
You're up in my room
You're somebody that I could always confide to
When there ain't nowhere to turn

You got my back when my back is against the wall
I love that, I don't like that at all
I love that, I don't like that at all
Yeah, you got my back when my back is against the wall
I love that, I don't like that at all
I love that, I don't like that at all

(Yeah)
I'm in love, I know what I'm into
Fell in love with you I ain't mean to
Jaw dropped to the floor first time I seen you
Said you were coming to L.A. couldn't wait to meet you
I'm obsessed for real, no pretend, ooh
Let's hit the bedroom, we got shit to tend to
I can feel my heart jump every time I see you
Got me feelin' cerebral, damn girl I need you


(Yeah)
I'm in love, I know what I'm into
Fell in love with you I ain't mean to
Jaw dropped to the floor first time I seen you
Said you were coming to L.A. couldn't wait to meet you
I'm obsessed for real, no pretend, ooh
Let's hit the bedroom, we got shit to tend to
I can feel my heart jump every time I see you
Got me feelin' cerebral, damn girl I need you
