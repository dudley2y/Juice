Wait, ayy

Pray to God I live another day (Oh, oh, oh)
Chopper on me, put it to your face (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm so high that I can't feel my face (Woah, woah, woah)
Chopper like a pencil, get erased (Go, go, go)
Shoot a motherfucker in the face (In the face)
She gon' give me top inside the Wraith (In the Wraith)
I keep all my rackades in the safe (Cha-ching, cha-ching)
Combination, put it in the safe

Combination, put it in the safe
I can't sleep until them pussies in the grave
What a day, what a day
Out of line, we gon' put you in your place
Claimin' you a shooter, knock it off, you ain't got no bodies
You a nobody, bloody and I'm cold hearted
Slidin' with my goons, that's my blood
Put you on the news, just because

Pray to God I live another day (Oh, oh, oh)

Me and D Savage boolin' by the lake (Woah, woah, woah)
Lookin' for some hoes to dinner date (Woah, woah, woah)
If niggas want some beef, we make 'em steak
Pull up on 'em, no license plates, leave a nigga too erased
Yeah, I stay up in the studio, ain't takin' no calls (Ain't takin' no calls)
My homies just took your bitch, my nigga, that's your fault (Uh, uh)
You talkin' shit to us, we leave you face down in the sidewalk (Uh, uh)
Don't gotta say much, load it up and I'm lettin' my gun talk, ayy
