Take my heart, take

Come and get your heart, I don't want it
You can pick it up on the corner
With the rest of your belongings
It’s over
Come and get your heart, I don't want it
You can pick it up on the corner
With the rest of your belongings
It's over, over

No composure, heart exposure
Sick to my stomach, got me turning over
I got your text, said you’re coming over
Poisoned love from a woman cobra
I dig myself up out of my grave every time
You really took your love in a way, I'll be fine
Just fine, finally suffering
I'm finally suffering

Go away, girl
Go away, go away, go away, girl
My heart, my heart is here to stay, girl
But this ain't a place for you to play, girl

Come and get your heart, I don't want it
You can pick it up on the corner
With the rest of your belongings
It's over
Come and get your heart, I don't want it
You can pick it up on the corner
With the rest of your belongings
It's over, over

No composure, heart exposure
Sick to my stomach, got me turning over
I got your text, said you’re coming over
Poisoned love from a woman cobra
I dig myself up out of my grave every time
You really took your love in a way, I’ll be fine
Just fine, finally suffering
I'm finally suffering

Go away, girl
Go away, go away, go away, girl
My heart, my heart is here to stay, girl
But this ain’t a place for you to play, girl

Come and get your heart, I don't want it
You can pick it up on the corner
With the rest of your belongings
It's over
Come and get your heart, I don't want it
You can pick it up on the corner
With the rest of your belongings
It’s over, over
