My nigga aiming too accurate when he shooting out the Acura (Ya dig)
I shot his mans in his face, now him and his friends mad at us (Ya dig)
They call me cheat code, I'm in the studio, they can't fathom us (Ya dig)
Do I look like a basketball to you? You can't handle us (Ya dig)
Pay me what you owe, if not, bullet in yo' skull
Glizzy make him dance, Jiga, Jiga, Jigalow
I ain't come to throw no hands, what this trigger for
Pour up a eight then hit this money dance, I ain't sippin' 4's
She made a porn with a kid, put it in my vlog
I done fell in love with the pill, it been that way for so long
I told that bitch that she can't wear a thong
Where the fuck else is we hiding the coke?
I heard yo' niggas was still up in jail
They takin' turns when they droppin' the soap

Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, shoot at me, they clap back
Santa Claus with these broads, come and sit on my lap
I fucked your broad, it's all my fault, I ain't mean to do that
Titty on the gun, the barrel low, aimin' where your crew at
Its been a wave, wavy niggas like a durag
You a slave, kill your ass where the noose at
Misbehave, I've been bad ever since food stamps
Skate on this block, I feel like Tony Hawk
I'ma hit on the corner like a Skate ramp
Oh, don't get involved
Bitch, I'm a boss, plus I'm a dog
Up that chopper, break your nigga face
Then I'm gon' break your lil' back like a law
Hit up his block, shot him just because
.223 right through the jaw
MP3's all in her phone
"Lucid Dreams" her favorite song

This that Kel-Tec talk (Oh, yeah)
This that Hi-Tech talk (Oh, yeah)
I can't stand up right now (Oh, yeah)
This that Hi-Tech walk (Oh, yeah)

I gotta rap it off (Oh, yeah)
I'm too raw to dog her (Oh, yeah)
I gotta wrap it up (Oh, yeah)
