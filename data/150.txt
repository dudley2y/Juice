ATL Jacob want some more
Oh, I'm down on the floor
Pills got me down on the floor
(ATL Jacob want some more, nigga)

Fire in my lungs, it's hard for me to talk
Poison words on my tongue, it almost fell out again
Codeine in my cup, it's hard me for me to walk
Mix it with the pills, I almost fell out again

Don't know when and where these demons came from
Don't know when and where, but all my demons starin'
Don't know when and where these demons came from
Don't know when and where, but all my demons starin'

Uh-huh, had a late night out, late night out, right back down
I'ma numb my pain with drugs and things, money powers
Yeah, I know these niggas are not my pals
Behind the back, now it's fake smiles
The snake tongues are hissing, how?
Uh, yeah, well I must be the chosen one
I see through all the glisten and glamour (Yeah)
It's amazing what niggas would do for the fame, they be on camera (Yeah)
Never thought like that, never will
I guess I'm too damn real, to care about what the people feel
So, I carry on, changing the world from dusk to dawn
Yeah, I know I do wrong, but I can't help it so I move along
Just keepin' it pushin', and I know that they lookin'
They won't see me fall, they won't see me crooked
Won't give 'em that satisfaction, I took it

Fire in my lungs, it's hard for me to talk
Poison words on my tongue, it almost fell out again
Codeine in my cup, it's hard me for me to walk
Mix it with the pills, I almost fell out again

Don't know when and where these demons came from
Don't know when and where, but all my demons starin'
Don't know when and where these demons came from
Don't know when and where, but all my demons starin'
