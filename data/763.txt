Run up on me then i run up on him with that chopper he hittin' the lab
I add it up i add the bodies up that is the aftermath
Up in school he wanna fight, I beat him up after class
Then I meet at the next class and beat him up after that
I had the last laugh
Bombin' like Baghdad, where my dad at?
Guess he a bad dad, that was his last chance
I am the last man, they killed everyone of my niggas

I'm a fuck a bitch so good, she gon' let me hit it from behind yuh
Matter fact i pull up on you wit' a chopper to yo brain and change your mind yuh
Im at the top of the top, but its still more to climb yuh
I change the climate, pull up on him im shining
Two tone skeleton A.P on the way rolly diamonds
Niggas talkin' down to me, but all this niggas under me
Actin' like some pirates, cause they tryna rob and plung-e me
But I ain't got no time, I just got my 40, and i got your shawty
