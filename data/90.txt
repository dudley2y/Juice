When I saw her

When I saw her
It was like a daydream, felt like yesterday
I won't love her
Love is such a sad thing, it gets in the way
I'm a stalker
I can see you're comin' from a hundred miles away
I should call her
Ring, ring, ring, baby, please don't make me wait, me wait (Me wait)

Let's have dinner by the lake, the lake
You can meet me 45 past 8
You look beautiful today, today
But I guess it's every day, okay
I don't wanna fall in love (Love)
But you makin' it too hard for me
I know I'm stuck in my ways (My ways, my ways)
But you been stuck in my mind all day
You been stuck in my mind all day
All day (Ooh)

When I saw her
It was like a daydream, I think I'm awake
I might love her
Love is such a new thing, it gets in the way
I'm a stalker
I can see you're comin' from a million miles away
I'ma call her
Ring, ring, ring, baby, please don't make me wait, me wait (Me wait)

Let's take a walk across the beach (Beach)
Let's go to my favorite place, LA
Don't know what's happenin' to me (To me, to me)
I think I'm fallin' in love, no way
Girl, this gotta be a dream (This gotta be a dream)
Damn, I gotta stay awake, awake
Now I find it hard to breathe (Breathe)
Every time I see your face (Face), your face (Your face)
You're so beautiful to me

When I saw her
It was like a daydream, I know I'm awake
Yeah, I love her
Love is such a strong thing, can't keep it away
I'm a stalker
I can hear her breathin' from a million miles away
I'ma call her
Ring, ring, ring, baby, please give me your time o' day (Day, day, day)

Please give me your time o' day (Day, day, day)
