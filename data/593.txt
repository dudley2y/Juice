Lyrics From Snippet

Psychedelics got me feeling myself (Myself)
Call a medic think I'm killing myself (Killing myself)
She told me that she gon' see me in Hell (See me in Hell)
I'm already there, I'm already there
Psychedelics got me feeling myself (Myself)
Call a medic think I'm killing myself (Killing myself)
She told me that she gon' see me in Hell (See me in Hell)
I'm already there, I'm already there

All my drugs are potent (Right)
Popping, drinking, smoking (Right)
I'm on Jimi Hendrix (Right), purple haze nigga
All these niggas trippin' (Right)
All these sneak dissers (Right)
Niggas be lyin' Pinocchio
Listen to Jiminy Cricket
Scratch them off, lottery ticket
You can't ball, JJ Redick
No face, no case - who did it?
I see three niggas in the mirror
Drugs got me trippin'

Psychedelics got me feeling myself (Myself)
Call a medic think I'm killing myself (Killing myself)
She told me that she gon' see me in Hell (See me in Hell)
I'm already there, I'm already there
Psychedelics got me feeling myself (Myself)
Call a medic think I'm killing myself (Killing myself)
She told me that she gon' see me in Hell (See me in Hell)
I'm already there, I'm already there

Need something new to do these other drugs are boring
I need a foreign girl American hoes are boring
I fuck her all night, diss her in the morning
No phone call, no phone call (Yeah)
No bathroom, I just stall (Yeah)
She gon' ball her eyes out, yeah heart tears
She gon' blow her boys out, skipping lightyears
She been going bad, knowing she gon' die there
I don't wanna die there
So she gotta die there
I been getting high there
Love them and leave them
Like James with the treatment

Psychedelics got me feeling myself (Myself)
Call a medic think I'm killing myself (Killing myself)
She told me that she gon' see me in Hell (See me in Hell)
I'm already there, I'm already there
Psychedelics got me feeling myself (Myself)
Call a medic think I'm killing myself (Killing myself)
She told me that she gon' see me in Hell (See me in Hell)
I'm already there, I'm already there (Yeah)
