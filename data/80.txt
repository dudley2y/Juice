Murda on the beat so it's not nice

Her love isn't free
Had to pay a fee
We don't get along, let's agree to disagree
Love ain't meant for me
I'm not meant for love
Only meant for drugs
Kissing on the lean
I get so damn high let it sweep me off my feet, bitch
Every time I'm high, I be as happy as can be, bitch
But on the inside I'm sad, I'ma let it bleed
Shouldn't have let her leave, shouldn't have let her leave

I remember when my first love hurt me
Woke up on the hospital gurney
Cupid as the doctor
Codeine in my IV, mix it with the Hi-C
Higher than a Hi-Fi, everyone below me
I was "Mr. Nice Guy" I guess that's the old me
Made me ball my eyes out, I deserve a trophy
Why you blocking my love? What are you, a goalie?
Startin' to feel the fame, don't know how to maintain it
You could be my heart even though that love's dangerous
Loner by choice I don't talk to strangers
Hold my hand I'ma walk with danger
And she cheated, put a knife to her throat, I'll slay her

Her love isn't free
Had to pay a fee
We don't get along, let's agree to disagree
Love ain't meant for me
I'm not meant for love
Only meant for drugs
Kissing on the lean
I get so damn high let it sweep me off my feet, bitch
Every time I'm high, I be as happy as can be, bitch
But on the inside I'm sad, I'ma let it bleed
Shouldn't have let her leave, shouldn't have let her leave

Baby I won't kill you that was just exaggeration
Or maybe it was real I'm super high and super angry
The way you left those scratches on my back you got me anxious
Cupid got an automatic and it keep on aimin'
I really got my eyes on you, no blinkin'
And I got my mind on you, no thinkin'
Wasting all my time on you, I'm tweakin'
Even though I'm in hell, my heart is freezin'

Her love isn't free
Had to pay a fee
We don't get along, let's agree to disagree
Love ain't meant for me
I'm not meant for love
Only meant for drugs
Kissing on the lean
I get so damn high let it sweep me off my feet, bitch
Every time I'm high, I be as happy as can be, bitch
But on the inside I'm sad, I'ma let it bleed
Shouldn't have let her leave, shouldn't have let her leave
