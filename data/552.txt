Yeah
Hey
Oh, oh
Murda on the beat so it's not nice

Bitch, you can't afford it
Ball like Michael Jordan
Get so high I'm soaring
Raf, no Lauren
She tells me that I drink too much
I tell her that she thinks too much
I ain't ever give no fucks
So I'ma go and pour me up

She tell me that she wanna fall in love
What is love? I don't know much
She tell me I'm infatuated with drugs
Maybe I should just slow up
Nah, I'ma keep it pushing
Pop a Xanny, use the Perky as a cushion
That lil' bitch, I'll fuck her if she gushing
Now her boyfriend looking at me crooked
Cool, I got something for that, in fact
Here, take a shot out the strap, relax
Bool, that's just what I do
I remember hoes was hating back in high school

Bitch, you can't afford it
Ball like Michael Jordan
Get so high I'm soaring
Raf, no Lauren
She tells me that I drink too much
I tell her that she thinks too much
I ain't ever give no fucks
So I'ma go and pour me up

I remember when I was sixteen
Thought I was gonna make it to the big leagues
Then I started rapping like oowie
Now they tryna ride me like a ten speed
Used to a baller, now I'm balling out with no court
How a nigga balling when you don't play no sports
Brother whipping with a fork, we had no forks
Brother whipping with a spork, we had no fork
These Xans, baby these not Advil
I'm sad, so I took a mad pill
I'm mad, so I took some more pills
Went from two to popping like four pills

Bitch, you can't afford it
Ball like Michael Jordan
Get so high I'm soaring
Raf, no Lauren
She tells me that I drink too much
I tell her that she thinks too much
I ain't ever give no fucks
So I'ma go and pour me up
