(Mega, you played that boy)

Ayy, I just bought a chopper with a scope
If D Savage tell me blow then I'ma blow
So, might wanna protect yourself
All headshots so the vest no help
Yeah, I was just boolin', smokin' dope
I'ma pop this Perc' just to float
And I keep a bag on me (Racks)
Ballin' like an athlete

I remember when they used to laugh at me
Now they want a feature so I'm taxin'
Pull up on a nigga from the back seat
Turn this fuckin' party to a track meet
Catch a opp, gun him down, yeah
Hundred rounds, fifty rounds
Make a move out of town
I was broke but I'm up now
Bad bitches wanna fuck now
In the trap with my guns out
Niggas fu', baby
I got bills to pay
Bitch, get on your knees
Bust all on her face
I go apeshit like a Bathing Ape
Cribs in different states but no real estate
Feel like Rick Ross, how I'm pushin' weight
Feel like Rick Ross, uh
Two guns, make you jump, call 'em Kris Kross, uh
R. Kelly with the funds, boy, you pissed off, uh
So get pissed on, uh
Ballin' out like a '89 Piston, ayy
VVS up on my wrist, I watch it glisten, ayy
I don't really see no competition, ayy
Me and D Savage water-whippin' in the kitchen, ayy
Ain't no Popeyes over here but we got chickens, ayy

Ayy, I just bought a chopper with a scope
If D Savage tell me blow then I'ma blow
So, might wanna protect yourself
All headshots so the vest no help
Yeah, I was just boolin', smokin' dope (Brr)
I'ma pop this Perc' just to float
And I keep a bag on me
Ballin' like an athlete (Athlete)
