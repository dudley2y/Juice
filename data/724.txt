Hey Martha, go get rid of those guys
Cuz I’m that was giving you codeine you ahh
Hey Samantha, you know that you fly
But I ain’t fucking with you unless you fuck her at the same damn time
Now that’s ecstasy
If you ain't sucking my dick but you rather V
I take comethazine and codeine that’s my medicine
I love codeine like the world loves Makonnen
I love morphine like the world loves Makonnen
Sex, love, and ecstasy all 3 in one moment
Sex, love, and ecstasy together like Jonas
I ball like Kobe that’s 3 shots plus a bonus
This is my own flow these niggas still got loaners(?)
I’m in the club with a forty on yo girlfriend thought it was a boner
Pints from Atlanta I feel like Desiigner when I rock designer
Lebron james when I take off bitch cuz I’m from lina
My shit change..
Kinda like the climate
Shoot like a range
Guess that’s perfect timing
Let’s go


Love, ecstasy
She thinks that I’m the one
So she's next to me
Sex, love, ecasty
I took hunnit pills a centipede
21 pills a century..
Poppin pills in elementary
I been popping pills since elementary
I’m in her mouth like “get her a dentist please”
I ball like Rodman on my bullshit feel like Dennis please
And if you ain’t gon fuck me and my homies let’s just leave
I promise it’s just me, and Makonnen on keys
Making raps and songs cuz I love to sing
And if rap game for real I gave that bitch a ring
Broke up with her no prenup she ain’t get a thing
