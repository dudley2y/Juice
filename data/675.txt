You know that I did it, I got it
I would be different without it
You say you get cash, bitch I doubt it
Ain't really, really 'bout it
Boy you ain't really 'bout it
Aye aye aye aye
Swoosh

Know that I did it, I got it
I would be different without it
Saucin' and saucin' the 
You gettin' cash, boy I doubt it

You smokin' loud, my shit louder
Heard you get cash, boy I doubt it
Heard you get cash, boy I doubt it
You took my bitch, boy I doubt it
You hit a lick, boy I doubt it
Heard that you wasn't about it
I heard that you wasn't about it
You gettin' cash, boy I doubt it
I'm on your ass, you surrounded
I doubt it, I doubt it

You gon' kill me, boy I doubt it
I told you, my niggas is 'bout it
All of my niggas go crazy
We do that shit on the daily
Wish a nigga tried to play me
Wish a nigga tried to play me
I keep persuadin'
Smokin' all this kush, I feel like a fucking Asian
Aye-aye, aye-aye
Who these niggas really tryna play
I'ma run it like a fuckin' race
I'm in that car like a getaway
Aye-aye, aye-aye
Told you niggas, I don't really play
Anywhere you go, you know you ain't safe
Aye-aye, aye-aye, aye-aye
I live my life like a getaway
I'm so high, I'm in another place
I don't really know what to say
Heard a nigga wasn't getting cake
So I don't really know what to say

Heard you gon' kill me, I doubt it
Nigga you know you ain't 'bout it
Yeah I heard that you weren't 'bout it
Said you gon' kill me, I doubt it
You gettin' cash, I doubt it

Say you gon' kill me, I doubt it
Heard you that nigga, I doubt it

Saucin', saucin', now I'm flossin' em
I'm in charge, a nigga bossin' em
They go talkin' all the tough stuff
Run up on em, get to flossin' on em
Getting money every day though
I'm in the cut like I am Fredo
In the cut like I am Tadoe
I got the  like it's Play-Dough
Told you niggas I don't play around

I'm getting cash right now and they playin' that catch up
I got a chopper right now and that bitch make you back up
I ain't talkin' 'bout no TV nigga, but these niggas gon' act up
Pourin' that act up
Leanin', leanin', I be feindin'
Poppin' xans and I am dreamin'
Shorty swallowin' my semen
And she swallowin' my demons
I be spittin' shit with meanin'
Niggas talking hella shit but I just spent 50K up in 
Margiela, Margiela, Margiela
Get money, bad future, fortune teller
I don't know if you could tell her
I take her then I leave her cherished
I fuck her then leave you embarrassed

You ain't 'bout it
I have the buildin' surrounded
Say you get it, man I doubt it
I doubt it
Doubt it, doubt it, doubt it
