That shit hard

You're such a drag
Remember I was flirtin' back in class
You ain't give me play, you made me sad
I done got to that cash
Laughing off my ass to the bank, why you mad?
Make sure when I'm on my way to the bank that I pass you
All this shit I got, you could've had too, too bad, ooh
You know I'm above you, baby, better check my latitude
And watch the way you talk, ‘cause you know I don't like no attitude

Oh yeah, I fell for the thick bitch with long hair
But I know that she don't love me for me
It's the money, baby, don't even go there
Hey, I would tell you slow your roll, but just stop it
The more cash in my pocket, the more you get out of pocket
You ain't runnin' up my cash, so you runnin' out of options
It's obvious, you ain't got fifty cents or some common sense
Hey, all the broke bitches hands in the air
You and your friends got y'all hands in the air
Over there, here's some shade for y'all hoes, you can share, yeah

You're such a drag
Remember I was flirtin' back in class
You ain't give me play, you made me sad
I done got to that cash
Laughing off my ass to the bank, why you mad?
Make sure when I'm on my way to the bank that I pass you
All this shit I got, you could've had too, too bad, ooh
You know I'm above you, baby, better check my latitude
And watch the way you talk ‘cause you know I don't like no attitude
