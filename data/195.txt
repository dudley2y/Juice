Uh
Going to motherfucking California
Finna go to Brooklyn tomorrow or some shit

Yeah, huh, I just got my passport, uh
Paul Walker in that Rarri, nigga, fast forward, uh
My life move too fast, fast, like you fast forward, uh, ayy
Slidin' with the MACs in that black four-door, uh
Make a nigga flip like he do parkour, uh
Movie with his bitch, yeah, we shot a hard porn
Choppa shoot, shoot, shoot, like his name BlocBoy
Red dots, headshots, bloody dreadlocks, boy

Ridin’ round I'm packing, in the trunk an automatic
If you want it, you can get it, like a TV, we give static
When I wake up in the morning, see a killer in the mirror
Used to have the same face, now, I look so unfamiliar
I'm not in the same place, I’m with the pros, you still play scrimmage
My pockets all green like Popeye, boy, you know I love my spinach (Uh-huh)
Money on your head, I send my brothers on a mission (Uh-huh)
I was just fucking with your bitch at her wedding dinner (Uh-huh)
Rick Owens, rocking Rick while that bitch don't got shit goin'
You ain't rich bitch, I'm rich better act like it
Bitch, you actin' childish, you need to timeout it
Or go talk to your mom about it
You been saying the wrong things, you need to stay silent
I'ma remain the same, same, I'ma stay solid
Ran into a newer bitch, I wonder if she riding
We gon’ see on the next episode of my life

Yeah, huh, I just got my passport, uh
Paul Walker in that Rarri, nigga, fast forward, uh
My life move too fast, fast, like you fast forward, uh, ayy
Slidin’ with the MACs in that black four-door, uh
Make a nigga flip like he do parkour, uh
Movie with his bitch, yeah, we shot a hard porn
Choppa shoot, shoot, shoot, like his name BlocBoy
Red dots, headshots, bloody dreadlocks, boy

Uh, I will not rent it
Most of these niggas ain't chasing a check, they chasing bitches
Why they trippin’, choppa make him dance like a video vixen
My brother hit me, asked me why I fall for these silly ass bitches
I was trippin', someone had to come put me back in my senses
Shorty different, funny how we started after the finish
But I've been sittin', admiring from afar for a fucking minute
Having visions, traveling abroad with her, making memories
If I think about that they’ll think about them Glocks, loading and bustin' semis
Yesterday she told me I should stop popping all them jimmies
And I told her I was hungry, uh, would you be my lunch?
She been tryna tell me the whole time, that's the dummy in me
I don't listen, I guess you were right, would you be my lunch?

Huh, I just got my passport, uh
Paul Walker in that Rarri, nigga, fast forward, uh
My life move too fast, fast, like you fast forward, uh, ayy
Slidin' with the MACs in that black four-door, uh
Make a nigga flip like he do parkour, uh
Movie with his bitch, yeah, we shot a hard porn
Choppa shoot, shoot, shoot, like his name BlocBoy
Red dots, headshots, bloody dreadlocks, boy
