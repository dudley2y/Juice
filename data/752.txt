Lyrics from Snippets

I want to own you, control you
Never seen a soul like yours before
Girl, I adore you, would die for you
Your ex won't though, with me, I'll show you

She my queen, instead have a dark king
Devil gets there first, waiting for me
Devil does his worst, he can't harm me
Sittin' there alone, I'm like, "You and what army?"
Baby, I can't help the way I feel
Got me havin' love dreams but this shit is real, real, real
Got me poppin' whole Percs, I don't know how to deal
Got me goin' on and on and I can't feel

Oh-oh, you belong, with me
Or no one at all

I want to own you, control you
Never seen a soul like yours before
Girl, I adore you, would die for you
Your ex won't though, with me, I'll show you

 sick, but I can never get sick of your love
 reachin' for...
...
...that you on

Oh-oh, you belong, with me
Or no one at all

I want to own you, control you
Never seen a soul like yours before
Girl, I adore you, would die for you
Your ex won't though, with me, I'll show you
