Ha, ya dig? (Yeah)
Ya dig? (Ya dig?)

.40 with a .30, that’s a dick, no stock, pause (Pause)
Talkin' all that shit'll get your ass popped off
Got your bitch doin’ cocaine 'till she lockjaw
Only did it once, don't know how it feels, you should ask her
Life of a rock star rap trapper
Keep me a guitar, AR, and a tractor
So I can see the snakes in the grass when I ride through (Hiss)
Got my nine (Yeah), pull up, blow it like a drive-thru (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I got crack, I'ma serve it out the drive-thru (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Your bitch is an Xbox, play her like Game Room, ayy (Ya dig?)
I was tweakin' off the Percs, mix it with the shrooms, ayy (Damn)
Now I'm itchin' seein' shadows in my fuckin’ room, ayy (Lucid dreams)
Cute chocolate bitch, that’s a fuckin' Reese’s (Uh)
Heard her nigga was talkin' shit, pull on him and crease him (That's right)
Snort the Molly off her tits, energy increasin'
Replenish me, prevent from finishing when I beat it, uh (Smash)
Rollie on my wrist, did it for the season (Uh)
Then I put a Patek on my wrist for no fuckin’ reason (Gleam, gleam)
Automatic in my grip, got it for a reason (Grrra, grrra, grra)
If a nigga try to take my shit, I'ma leave him bleedin' (Bitch)

Ayy, bad lil' bitch, you know I seen her
She seen me, sell-out arenas
Gun on me, Gilbert Arenas
Take a nigga to the cleaners (Uh)

All white ones with crack rock in the sneakers (Uh)
I'm ballin' out while they sittin' on the bleachers (Yeah)
Get rich just to go back and fuck on my teachers (Uh)
None of them believed in me either (Woo)
Now they hit my Twitter congratulatin' me (Woo)
Nigga, I don't fuck with y'all people
Old hoes hit me up, I'm sorry
I wasn't tryin' to make love to y'all either (Hiss)
Yeah, I don't need 'em (Hiss)
Pretty bitch, good facial features (Uh)
Three blunts to the face then I eat her (Yeah)
Two Percs to the face, I'm geekin' (Uh)
Gotta put them down, I'm tweakin' (Uh)
Sometimes it feels like I need 'em (Uh)
Sometimes I feel so defeated (Uh)
