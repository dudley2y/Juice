I hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
Yeah, I hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no tellin' where we'll end up

Last night was a blur, so girl I wasn't sure
If we made love or if we made something more
Last thing I remember is me walking out the door
Next thing you know, woke up on the floor
I don't know who's house this is but I know I'm in Hollywood
Scramble for my keys then I stumble to the car
I look in the backseat, what do I see?
Bro passed out, laying next to a bad broad
Looks like they had a good time
I must've took us for some reason, I can't remember my night
Reach in my pockets, what do I find?
Half a Percocet, 200 dollars, and a weed pipe
That's when somebody hit my phone line
Saying that the day was wild, asking if I'm alright
I don't know what happened but I wanna know
I guess we gotta do it all over again, nice

I hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no tellin' where we'll end up

Here we go again, woke up in a bed
But it wasn't my bed, who's is this?
Things are kinda blurry, I can't see shit
Wrapped around my body I see two tattoed hands
Last night more blank then the night before
At least I made it to a bed, last time I woke up on the floor
All I could remember is a bitch screaming more, more, more, more
Videos in my phone, we were in a high-speed chase and a white robe
Looks like we threw them hands too, here's a clue, knuckles bruised
There's somebody else's blood on my elbows
Lately I been blackin' out, drugs getting too strong
Buying all the pills from the plug, money too long
I get high to let go and find out where I belong
Probably by my Vlone, party with my demons

I hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no tellin' where we'll end up
