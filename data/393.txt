Damn
Backwood smoke got a nigga float, huh
Ayy, thanks, foe
You know what I'm sayin', foe, I say

Backwood smoke make a nigga float (Woo)
Good trash talk get a nigga smoked (Woo)
I bought my first gun with an extendo (Woo, yeah)
You'll be fucked up if I let it go (Woo)
Yeah, I keep it tucked like a cell phone (Woo), like a cell phone (Woo)
Heard you need them bales, ho (Woo), hit my cell phone (Woo)
I'm too high to FaceTime (Woo), fuck my cell phone (Woo)
All I do is waste time (Woo), on my cell phone (Woo)

Your bitch all on my line (Woo), yeah, my cell phone (Woo)
I travel through her mind (Woo), via cell phone (Woo)
Niggas threatenin' my life (Woo), via cell phone (Woo)
That ain't beef, ho (Woo), you look like a vegan, ho (Woo)
Fuck her, we don't speak no more
Don't go to church, can't preach no more
I put a ring around her throat
So that lil' slut don't leave no more
I can't sip no lean no more
Still gon' sip some lean some more
Mix it with that Perky and that Henny
I'm unconscious

I ride Forgiatos, them stop and gos
Herm√®s joggers, two thousand year olds
That ain't your two door, you got it off Turro
My Latino bitch cook cinnamon churros
My marble floors glossy, it look like a mural
My spot automated, I talk to Alexa
Not really a foreign if it is a Lexus
Got a brunette, she go to Loyola
Toyota pickup, a Tacoma model
I one way to New York to rub on a model
I had a bitch spun like John Leguizamo
Got art on my wall, but not by Picasso
Two custom pieces I got from Art Basel
I travel, no luggage, I'm savin' the hassle
I eat at Spondivits, that shit like White Castle
Got rips in my Balmains, I lock up the racks in 'em
