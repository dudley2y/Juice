Fire, I'm on fire (Ah)
Candle
L-Lean

Fire, I'm on fire
I'm getting higher, higher, higher
Hell on earth coming down to the wire
Inspire until I perspire
Higher, higher, higher
I'm on fire, fire, fire
Hell on earth comes down to the wire
Inspire, until I perspire

These niggas my sons, well fuck them kids
My dad told me that once, so how can I forget?
Hard work gotta pay off (It does) if you wanna live like this (Uh-huh)
I don't really got no cough, but there's codeine in my piss (Codeine in my piss)
Slime hit me like I'm rich (Slime hit me like I'm rich)
Say I gotta start acting like I'm rich
I'm flying through the skies in the car like Rick
Play your bitch like Guitar hit her like a riff
Got the Raf Simons like the first name riff
You catch these hands you gon' catch my drip (Let's go)
Surfin' that bitch like some wave around and if you got a problem, my fault
All I know is get money, get money, get money
If it ain't about that, then just leave me alone
I'm rolling up backwoods, I don't smoke out a bowl
Now I swallow these pills I've been losing control
Take a Percocet 30 and then I take some more
Plus all that promethazine you know I'ma pour

Fire, I'm on fire
I'm getting higher, higher, higher
Hell on earth coming down to the wire
Inspire until I perspire
Higher, higher, higher
I'm on fire, fire, fire
Hell on earth comes down to the wire
Inspire, until I perspire

I told you I'm these niggas dad (I Am), and it's making them mad
I run a whole country, shit getting funny ain't American dad
You run up on me, then that choppa is munchin'
It's getting hungry, I'm a gun junkie
Where I come from this shit look like Jumanji
Chicago bitch better wrap up, no mummy
All these bands, I can fuck your mommy
She ain't as pretty as your lil' auntie, ayy
Gun tell me get my family safe
Stay the fuck outta my business, then fuck outta my way
These lil' niggas try to fuck up the wave
Me? I'm just tryna fuck up a safe
Some of the millions I have, I save
But remember you cannot take it to your grave
Who? Me? Nigga, you want some beef with me?
You must be a dummy
Bitch, I'm on NLMB, that's a team
Bitch, I'm on NLMB, that's the gang
Bitch, I'm on NLMB with some kings
Doing my thang, always come through with the heat, like

Fire, I'm on fire
I'm getting higher, higher, higher
Hell on earth coming down to the wire
Inspire, until I perspire
Higher, higher, higher
I'm on fire, fire, fire
Hell on earth comes down to the wire
Inspire, until I perspire
