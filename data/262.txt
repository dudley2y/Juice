I see eyes, in the hills
Need a cabinet, filled with pills
Need a house, filled with hoes
With the floors, made of gold
Need a safe, filled with guns
I need women, more than one
Need a Wraith, just to crash it
I'm tryna live lavish

I'm tryna live lavish
Live like every day my last, shit
She say she love my old tape
This is way better than my last shit
Get rich overnight, I can't exaggerate
I can't wait to move my momma in a better place
I took my women to L.A. to Californicate
We damn near arguin' every time that she go away
Plus these hoes wanna fuck on me
But I won't let em' fuck on me
I know these bitches be scandalous, I can't handle it
So I let my woman handle it, she gon' vandal it

I see eyes, in the hills
Need a cabinet, filled with pills
Need a house, filled with hoes
With the floors, made of gold
Need a safe, filled with guns
I need women, more than one
Need a wraith, just to crash it
I'm tryna live lavish

Every day, I'm slappin'
I keep a liquor bottle in my lap
And I keep a drug sack in my baggie
Trap house in my baggie


I see eyes, in the hills
Need a cabinet, filled with pills
Need a house, filled with hoes
With the floors, made of gold
Need a safe, filled with guns
I need women, more than one
Need a wraith, just to crash it
I'm tryna live lavish (Ye)
