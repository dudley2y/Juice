Go 'head, O
Danny I see you!

Take off, fast forward
In a black Porsche
Whippin' all the white, even though I'm a black boy
Terry Crews, flexin' on your crew, steroids
She lookin' at us, like I love them boys
Take off, fast forward
In a black Porsche
Whippin' up the white, even though I'm a black boy
Terry Crews, flexin' on your crew, steroids
Lookin' at us, like damn I love them boys

Pull up Taskforce, in a four-door
Choppa on my hip, it's heatin' up like human torch
If I catch him I'ma score, wait
Hit the floor
Then I take his whore, ayy, in that order
Bought a bunch of Gucci fits it cost about a quarter
25k not 25 cents bitch, oh yeah
Big gun make a nigga walk with a limp bitch, oh yeah
I still wear Bathing Ape, no chimp bitch, oh yeah
Everyday I pour, lean
Need some more
Broke niggas askin' the cost I tell 'em a quarter
25 hundred not 25 cents bitch, oh yeah
25 pints cost 25 bricks bitch, oh yeah

Take off, fast forward
In a black Porsche
Whippin' all the white, even though I'm a black boy
Terry Crews, flexin' on your crew, steroids
She lookin' at us, like I love them boys
Take off, fast forward
In a black Porsche
Whippin' up the white, even though I'm a black boy
Terry Crews, flexin' on your crew, steroids
Lookin' at us, like damn I love them boys

Need a beautiful girl, no Sean Kingston
Life of a lonely boy, all these hoes tweakin'
She gon' suck me in the back of the Porsche, then she leavin'
If the pussy good, I'm a hit her repeat
Hit it 3 times, call the shit three-peat
I've been Xan free, almost been 3 weeks
Still on beans, still on Percs, still on Codeine
She say coke, ain't a joke
She get nose bleeds (Yeah)
She finna OD, don't call the police (Yeah)
Pray the drugs don't take her home, yeah
Say that she okay, but she not okay
Molly takin' over her soul
Another love goes down the drain, where it belongs
Another love goes, where the drugs go

Take off, fast forward
In a black Porsche
Whippin' all the white, even though I'm a black boy
Terry Crews, flexin' on your crew, steroids
She lookin' at us, like I love them boys
Take off, fast forward
In a black Porsche
Whippin' up the white, even though I'm a black boy
Terry Crews, flexin' on your crew, steroids
Lookin' at us, like damn I love them boys
