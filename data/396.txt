I'm a young rich nigga, I done got my funds up
Don't matter where you go, when they play my shit, they hands up
In the Royce, yeah, yeah, the Rolls, pulling up in the Phantom
Yeah, yeah, me or my gang stuck together
Where I come from, it get cold, nigga better keep his hammer
Two options in that life, dead or in the slammer
We deserve a better life, had to get to them bands
Yeah, yeah, yeah, gettin' rich together

I've struggled for so long, I got my feet up
It's just me, and my money, and my woman, and my keeper
How could I forget my Smith and Wesson, heater
I wake up, I thank God, turn to the side, then I kiss my broad
For worse, and for better, me and her are for forever
She, yeah, her, my obsession, my obsession
We belong together

I'm a young rich nigga, I done got my funds up

Yeah, yeah, me and my gang stuck together
Where I come from, it get cold, nigga better keep his hammer
Two options in that life, dead and in the slammer
We deserve a better life, had to get to them bands
