So alone
Count the money while my lonely (Money while my lonely)
I ain't really fucking with the police (I ain't really fucking with the police)
And you know I keep it on me (And you know I keep it on me)
I ain't really fucking with the-
I ain't really fucking with the police
Enviyon on the mix

She told me she in love with the old me
But I don't love the old me
In the fourth quarter balling like Kobe
I'm super clutch just like Gin贸bili
Time is money so I went and got a rollie
New girl looking like a trophy
She do the cocaine till her nose bleed (Nose bleed, nose bleed)
And she don't even know me (And she don't know me, know me)

I've been balling while you sitting in the nose bleeds
911, I don't fuck with police
Niggas claim they know me when they don't know me
Say you a real nigga, better show me, ayy
I don't fuck with no one (Ayy)
Brother locked up, told you that's that Akon (Ayy)
I got AKs spilling like I'm Osam, ayy (Ayy)
Pop a Xan then I forgot, ayy (Ayy)
I forgot to remember her name
Life is a picture I guess I got my hand in the frame (Hand in the frame, hand in the frame)
I forgot to remember her name
Life is a picture and I got all my hands in the frame

She told me she in love with the old me
But I don't love the old me
In the fourth quarter balling like Kobe
I'm super clutch just like Gin贸bili
Time is money so I went and got a rollie
New girl looking like a trophy
She do the cocaine till her nose bleed (Nose bleed, nose bleed)
And she don't even know me (And she don't know me, know me)

They sing the right songs they just hit the wrong notes
Remember old days when I had my heart broke
And now I'm in the stu' and I love to spit dope
Brought brother in the trap and he love to fix dope
These niggas never change I could never fix broke (Fix broke)
I run up on his ass, get the shooter Rambo (Rambo)
I know some niggas brazy, they red like Elmo (Like Elmo)
I'm sticking to the money like I got velcro (Velcro)
You say you getting money but I know it's hell no
You don't got no Adidas but I give you shell toes (Shell toes)
I'm balling like Shaquille I'ma throw an elbow (Ayy)
You don't get no birds like a fucking scarecrow

She told me she in love with the old me
But I don't love the old me
In the fourth quarter balling like Kobe
I'm super clutch just like Gin贸bili
Time is money so I went and got a rollie
New girl looking like a trophy
She do the cocaine till her nose bleed (Nose bleed, nose bleed)
And she don't even know me (And she don't even know me, know me)

I don't love the old me
Balling like Kobe
Gin贸bili
