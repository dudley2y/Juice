And we throwin' shells in this bitch

I'm with my nigga from the Nolia and he down to let it spark
I forgot to mention that my bitch got a AR
Got a couple lil' tools, put you in the graveyard
Short barrel AR, but it got a big bark
These ain't no .22 bullets, they leave more than a scar, boy
Hit you up like Lavagirl and leave you swimmin' like Sharkboy
From the Nolia to Chicago, we'll be down to let it spark, boy
Rifle bullets so sharp, thought I hit you with a dart, boy

Best not let me catch you walking through the park, boy
Big bro keep two revolvers, he a cowboy
Leave you with a shit bag, you got bloody farts, boy
Infrared dots, let me get you in the dark, boy
I ain't gon' say too much, I'm 'bout the action
Lost my brother so I'm never with the lackin'
Shit get bloody, real bloody, no napkin
We was getting scummy for the money, makin' it happen
Grrah, I unload the clip, uh
I ain't going to throw no fist at all, you can suck a dick, uh
Bullets pin you to the wall, you a poster, kid, uh
Should've stayed your ass in school like you 'posed to, kid
Twelve gauge shotty, I been on my trucker shit, uh
SK, no karate, let that motherfucker kick
Back in the day, I ain't trap on text, hit me on my Kik, uh
Feds ain't catchin' shit, uh
Treat this gun like this brick, I'm gon' get that bitch off

I'm with my nigga from the Nolia and he down to let it spark
I forgot to mention that my bitch got a AR

Short barrel AR, but it got a big bark
These ain't no .22 bullets, they leave more than a scar, boy
Hit you up like Lavagirl and leave you swimmin' like Sharkboy
From the Nolia to Chicago, we'll be down to let it spark, boy
Rifle bullets so sharp, thought I hit you with a dart, boy

From the Nolia to Chicago, got 'em killers on deck
Act up if you want, stick gorillas on you
Banana clips for the monkeys that been comin' at us
And they ain't runnin' up on us, they probably runnin' from us
Tattoos on my body, I need tears by my eyes
In my dirt, I admit it, but I'm still here alive
Tryna thrive, tryna vibe to survive, get the bands
Look at my closet, you gon' think I came from Afghanistan
I don't talk shit, I let the stick talk shit
Shots hit him in his chest, got him crip walkin'
I'ma limp like a pimp, that's the stick walkin'
When I close, when I aim like Slick Rick popped him
Shout out Herbo, that's my slime, shout out Bibby, he gon' ride
Shout out Maneski, he gon' pull up with them guns and make 'em fly
Shoutout D from the Nolia, catch 'em and shoot 'em by my side
Heatseekers in his Glizzy, you can't run and you can't hide

I'm with my nigga from the Nolia and he down to let it spark
I forgot to mention that my bitch got a AR
Got a couple lil' tools, put you in the graveyard

Rifle bullets so sharp, thought I hit you with a dart, boy

I don't talk shit, I let the stick talk shit
Shots to his chest, got him crip walkin'
I been gettin' high off the Skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the Moonrock shit
Stick talk, let the stick talk shit
Shots to his chest, got him crip walkin'
I been gettin' high off the Skywalk shit
Then I mix it up with the Moonrock shit
