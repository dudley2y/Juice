Wheezy outta here

Yeah
I get higher than the murder rate (Huh, yeah)
Shut the fuck up, I can't concentrate (Huh, shit, yeah)
If he try me today, he gon' die today
On my knees, I been praying for brighter days
Got the meter assist, shot a fade away (Hoo, shit, yeah)
I be up working all night and day
Your bitch swallow my dick, said she proud of me
No one knew me, now bitches surrounding me
Ain't no new me, I won't ever change, oh
All my niggas, they really stay down for me
Double R, SUV, and a Range Rove'
I'ma pull off, I'm doing a high speed

Weezy F made it, I'm finna kill it, go ahead and bury it
I got my gun, I'ma Mariah Carey it
I love the money so much, I'ma marry it
Don't know how to act, I feel like a barbarian
He don't want beef, that nigga vegetarian
Gun with a silencer, like a librarian
I be the reason all these bitches staring
She swallow my kids, not good at parenting
Pay me a hundred-fifty for appearances
I got a Lamborghini from the dealership
If I don't buy a car, I put it on my wrist (Gleam, gleam)
Rocking red, just like Popovich
Shooting like Stockton, ain't nobody stopping it
They pocket watching, ain't nobody robbin' this
Give him the MAC-11 with the cooling kit (Ooh-ooh)
My niggas coming for you (Ooh)
My niggas coming for you (Ooh)
Ain't no telling what they gon' do
Catch you at the red light, pull up, vroom
She ride my dick like a witch on a broom
When he walked in, we smell bitch in the room
Ayy, shoot that dude
Brah-brah-brah coming out that tool

Yeah
I get higher than the murder rate (Huh, yeah)
Shut the fuck up, I can't concentrate (Huh, shit, yeah)
If he try me today, he gon' die today
On my knees, I been praying for brighter days
Got the meter assist, shot a fade away (Hoo, shit, yeah)
I be up working all night and day
Your bitch swallow my dick, said she proud of me
No one knew me, now bitches surrounding me
Ain't no new me I won't ever change, oh
All my niggas, they really stay down for me
Double R, SUV and a Range Rove'
I'ma pull off, I'm doing a high speed

Freestyle on Instagram
Live bitch I'm getting this money I stack it
Heartbreak, Music it happens
I thank god I made it at rapping
Like a poetry slam I be snapping
I'm Sick of these goofy's reacting
They just wanna get a reaction
But see I can't let that shit happen
I'ma speak on the real shit
Problems that nobody don't wanna speak on
Problems that every single one of us deal with
Just tell the devil to be gone
Look in the mirror like nigga we on
I feel like Drake cause nigga we made it
Look in the mirror my eyes is red is hell fire
Like my nigga I'm faded
Fuck is you saying run up on me and I'm spraying
But I really hate all the violence
See I'm from Chicago where niggas be killing to kill
We'll Kill to keep them quiet
And that's just a problem I got to solve it
I don't got the answers
I just be looking
Anxiety tweaking
It got me Geeking
It got shaking
Don't what I'm doing but fuck it I do it
Fuck I ball like I'm Kobe
I'm in the forth like Ginobili
You know what you told me
They told me time is money
So I need APs and a Rollie(Ayy)
Run up on me boy you foonie
I just may go pass that gun to my homie(Ayy)
I got snaked on by my brodie
And I know it(Hah)

Pull on me the injured may die today
But I'm not trying cry today
