(Do you realize)
Do  you realize the real?

Do you realize the real?
I  can tell you lost in your feels
I can show you real life for real
I see through the real eyes

I  can tell you lost in your feels
I can show you real life for real
See it through the real eyes

I see it through the real eyes
Hoping that she realize
There aren't too many real guys
She realize
I'm hoping that she realize
I'm hoping that she don't cry
I'm hoping that she won't die
I know she getting too high
I try to really make her realize
Baby go 'head and bite that bullet
Trigger to your head I just might pull it
Won't let you hurt me not again
I'll make you realize
Baby go 'head and bite that bullet
Trigger to your head I just may pull it
Won't let you hurt me not again
I'll make you realize
Do you realize?
Do you realize?
Do you realize the real
The real‚ the real

Do you realize the real?
I can tell you lost in your feels
I can show you real life for real
I see through the real eyes
Do you realize for real?
I can tell you lost in your feels
I can show you real life for real
See it through the real eyes
