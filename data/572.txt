Hmm, uh
Hmm, uh
Yeah (Me and Swervo hit the turbo)
I won't love you, bitch I use you
All these percocets I do, ayy
I won't love you but I'll use (You ain't got no use)
All these percocets I do

I don't trip about it no more, I got used to it (Trip)
You can't give me too much baby, I might use you (I'm gon' trip)
I gotta get this money, if not I might lose you (I'm gon' get)
Told them drugs "I love you, that's why I abuse you"
I fuck on them other bitches, but I choose you (I just fucked)
'Cause at the end of the day, you know they bitches foo foo (They don't mean nothin')
You would ride for me, that's something they won't do (You would ride)
I don't entertain the fuck shit, I amuse you (I don't)

When you say you love me, is it true?
'Cause I ain't been seein' the same, baby, I need visuals
Why you always beefin' with me? Why's it always an issue with you?
I don't feel like yellin' right now
I can't text while I drive, I keep a pistol with two, uh
How you think I'm rich? I get to it, uh
Work like a bitch, I get to it, uh

Still have time to talk about you on my interludes
Look at this shit that we've been through
Right now, I'm with Swervo, swervin' up in the turbo
Saw your text message I cannot get to, yeah
But when I touch down, bitch top me down
In my car with the roof drop top when the top is down
I got a confession, I'm usin' them percs when we fuck
They help me knock you down
We got the neighbors pissed off, they hear the boots knockin' loud
But, ayy
We gon' still get it brackin' either way
Don't hit my phone right now, bitch, I'm busy
Me and Swervo smokin' out the P's ayy, huh
Make it look easy

Uh, uh, man spinnin' my shit, who the DJ? (Where the DJ at?)
Swervo, yeah that's my shit, it's on replay (That's on replay, ayy, you dig?)
Runnin' laps 'round you fuck niggas, no relay
I can't wait for the check, I'ma hop on the jet 'cause that bitch don't delay (That bitch don't)
150 sport mode on the freeway (Woah, woah)
Slidin' through traffic whenever we late (Woah, woah)
Time is money, no we ain't late
Two hours back, now we in LA (Uh, uh)
I'm with 150 they makin' it spray
Yeah, please stay out of my way
Get around to it, we'll make it your way
We really got no limits, ayy
Me and Juice WRLD plottin', making a play
I pass it to Swerve, he fade away
Playing basketball for 10k
What's your yearly salary? We spend in a day
Broke niggas my allergy, get out the way
If they in the way, catch a shot to the face
Slang you like that slang, yeah
Killin' shit in the game, wait
Shot at your niggas, don't come through straight
We gon' get money anyway
Why you hatin' on me? You gay
And this ain't no boxing, this plain as day
Bitch came too, she's doin' the most
Pass her around, now she's doin' the bros
She ate my bitch in the back of the Rolls
How she drive and give top to a passenger, though?
In the Bentley truck, now the Aston, the Ghost
We don't go no respect, we gon' ash on the floor
Pull up on your ho', get that ass, then I ghost
Back to the studio, back to the dough

I don't trip about it no more, I got used to it (Trip)
You can't give me too much baby, I might use you (I'm gon' trip)
I gotta get this money, if not I might lose you (I'm gon' get)
Told them drugs "I love you, that's why I abuse you"
I fuck on them other bitches, but I choose you (I just fuck)
'Cause at the end of the day, you know they bitches foo foo (They don't mean nothin')
You would ride for me, that's something they won't do (You would ride)
I don't entertain the fuck shit, I amuse you (No, no, no)
