When I saw her

When I saw her
It was like a daydream, felt like yesterday
I won't love her
Love is such a sad thing, giggles in the way
I'm a stalker
I can see you're comin' from a hundred miles away
I should call her
Ring, ring, ring, baby, please don't make me wait, me wait

Let's have dinner by the lake
You can meet me 45 past 8
You look beautiful today
But I guess it's everyday, okay
I don't wanna fall in love
But you makin' it too hard for me
I know I'm stuck in my ways
But you been stuck in my mind all day
You been stuck in my mind all day

You been stuck in my mind all day
All day

When I saw her
It was like a nightmare, I've been so scared
When I loved her
I was loving blind, now i'm seeing stuff in time
Now I hate
The way that I'ma baller, the way I'm gonna drop her
I'ma drop her
Guess I'ma heart breaker I hate you

I'ma take your girl out your hands
Yeah I really need this ice
I'ma treat you good
Let a real man treat you nice
Don't know whats happening to me
Feel like I'm asleep feel like i am in a dream
But wait
Shout-out juice its gonna be lucid
You don't like the way that I do it
Flexing on six and navy cause this is a remix
This is a real diss this is the real shit
You are some kids too
And now I'm taking care of you
