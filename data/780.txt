Verse (?)
??? Don't nobody wanna leave me 'lone
I could die out on my own
So I don't need your help no
Mixin drugs up so much need to be careful
Havin bad thought bitch I got a handful
Takin over me is something I can't handle
(ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh)
Chorus
Here we go again (Damnnn)
Here we go again
