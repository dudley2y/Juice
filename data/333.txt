Even when I'm sleep I feel awake, when you're awake
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowing you were gonna walk away, you can be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
But for you imma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you through the hell and the flames
Always, always, love you always

For your love working all day, fuck a off day
You looking cute in your bape shit baby, you can go ape
All these other bitches are shanaynays Martin like pain
I'm in love with a beautiful lady, she's in my brain
Star you set my heart on fire, 420 blaze
Yeah no clich√©, I can't explain, I got your name
Tatted on my brain, tatted on my mind
Teen titan got the Starfire by my side
Clark Kent, if she kiss me it make me fly
Sad boy, if she leaves me it makes me cry
Flash boy, if she needs me be there in no time
She's alright
So I gave it a go, I gave it a turn
I gave my heart, I'm willing to learn
And it changed my life
I'm trying get to close with the stars tonight

Even when I'm sleep I feel awake, when you're awake
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowing you were gonna walk away, you can be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
But for you imma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you through the hell and the flames
Always, always, love you always
