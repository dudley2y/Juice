(Verse)
See how versatile I can get (uhuh)
Okay, I'll say a few words on this
Ohh aye uh mm mm mm
Okay look
High as fuck, drunk as fuck
In the back of the car like what the fuck
Bad bitch at the crib, high as fuck off the drugs, suck me up
I was high, not her
She was sober, tryna' get a upper cut
Hit em in the stomach with the choppa' til the fuck nigga had enough
Freestyle shit that they take years to think up, thats true
Pull up on the scene, leave em inked up choppa' like a tattoo
You ain't know, she ain't know, he ain't know
Nigga, I'm that dude
Matter fact make you break your back like break dance, old school
Freestyle type to pull up, put the gun to your youth group
Matter fact take a chain on your wrist, slave you up useful
Hell yeah ya bitch I meant use you
Beat it up, beat it up, Mike Tyson I abuse you
Flow gold, so cold like diamonds fuck that rose gold
.40 on me it'll sneeze, grab a Kleenex got a bad cold
Pull up on him, hit him in his face twice, now he got a bad nose
I'm the type to pull up on the scene full of shit like a asshole
My flow is so cold, my flow is so cold its so cool
These niggas so lame, these niggas so old Im so new
Pull up on the scene just me no guys I'm solo
Feel like Kudi cause I'm still rockin' the Dolo
Box all on my logo, you bitch she a hoe hoe
Stick on me yeah the stick on and its super big, no homo
Niggas talking that dumb shit hit em in his ears, no Dumbo
Not in my house with a tumble
Left right left right, thats a combo
I'ma serve it like cilantro
Kill a nigga in his condo
Then I fuck his bitch his condo
I hit this Og, let his mom know
I am the bomb hoe, I blow up just like a bomb hoe
Just let your mom know
Juice he got that old sound flow (yeah)
I ain't ever gotta write (uuhh)
Im the shit to these niggas like damn
Do I ever gotta wipe (yuuh)
Pull up on em with the gun like damn
That nigga finna die (yeah)
Ima overkill overkill  (yeah aye)
R.I.P. to my fallin' ones, I just lost my brother, for real (uh)
Im sick of lookin' at the news, I may lose another, for real (yuh)
Everybody keep on snitchin on em, they ain't undercovers, for real (yuh)
Its how I catch em lackin' sleepin with each others under covers for real (yuh)
Man
Shit gets real out here
Withdrawals a bitch, Ive been takin too many pills out here
Tryna live out here, no advils
Fucked the bitch on my adlibs
Said that twice cause shit is mad real
Man
Westwood throw on some different shit
Im still rappin' on it 'cause I'm showin' the distance between me and these other niggas
Like I said I can fuck your mother nigga
Like I said I can fuck your baby sitter
Like I said I'm here to baby niggas, for real
