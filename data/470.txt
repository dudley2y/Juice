Ayy Oz, you a big dog now, you get to bark
Uh

Diggin' up bones in the graveyard
Lookin' at the past, ain't as easy as it looks
I'm a bad kid with a great heart
With a head that's everywhere, except for in the books
Still book smart and street smart
I see everything, I don't need a second look
Let me tell you somethin' 'bout me, sweetheart
You will never understand me, I'm so misunderstood

Questions and questions for days
Better move along, I'm gon' answer wrong
I may put the answers somewhere hidden in this song
The truth is disgusting to me
But I've been doing wrong
I've been leaning hard, then I hit the bong
Keep a firearm, no, I'm not a bodyguard
Party every day, fuckin' up my body parts
Territorial, leavin’ her with body marks
Then my eyes get big, that's when the molly starts
I'm gon' dive right in, she like a water park
Broke the bed again, oh, that's my fault
Well, it's our fault, uh, yeah

Diggin' up bones in the graveyard
Lookin' at the past, ain't as easy as it looks
I'm a bad kid with a great heart
With a head that's everywhere, except for in the books
Still book smart and street smart
I see everything, I don't need a second look
Let me tell you somethin' 'bout me, sweetheart
You will never understand me, I'm so misunderstood
