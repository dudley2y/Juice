Lyrics from Snippets

I don't like revolvers, they only hold six
Yeah, I hang with them demons, them 6-6-6
Yo' bitch swallowing my semen
Bank account is lookin' big
Yeah, my pockets lookin' big
Ayy, pockets lookin' big
Uh, uh

Bank account lookin' big
.40 make you dance like a jig
You in the way, put a hole in your wig
Desert eagle on me, bitch, the bullet hole big
I don't like revolvers, they only hold six
Yeah, I hang with them demons, them 6-6-6
Yo' bitch swallowing my semen
Forgetting the meaning, that's self respect
Fuck her face then put it on the Internet

When I see diamonds, my senses start twinglin' (Young SEX)
Young nigga, twelve phones, all of 'em ringin'
Like 'Br br! Hello, do you need me?'
Like 'Br br! Hell no, baby beat it'
Army green...
...
'Cause I spend all my money on my friends
...
How the fuck your drip...
...

Bank account lookin' big
.40 make you dance like a jig
You in the way, put a hole in your wig
Desert eagle on me, bitch, the bullet hole big
I don't like revolvers, they only hold six
Yeah, I hang with them demons, them 6-6-6
Yo' bitch swallowing my semen
Forgetting the meaning, that's self respect
Fuck her face then put it on the Internet

I just been landing...
...so I'm not a natural
Double cup with that red lean, I'ma sip classy
Dior on my feet, I feel classy
You say you love me, do you mean that?
I don't think so, she wasn't there when I was down bad
I don't think so, bitch, I know so
Money by the boatload
I know why these hoes acting nice
'Cause I'm a rich guy
You ain't on shit, let that shit fly
Taking trips off of the Percs I be sky high
In the sky sippin' on red lean like its red wine, red wine

Bank account lookin' big
.40 make you dance like a jig
You in the way, put a hole in your wig
Desert eagle on me, bitch, the bullet hole big
I don't like revolvers, they only hold six
Yeah, I hang with them demons, them 6-6-6
Yo' bitch swallowing my semen
Forgetting the meaning, that's self respect
Fuck her face then put it on the Internet
