Don't care what no niggas say, I'm gettin to this paper
I'm too rich to listen anyways so save that shit for later
Bitch, my bank account on heavyweight, my shit on Joe Frazier
I get high so I can elevate, fly over a hater
Four-forty make 'em hyperventilate, gun or blood thinner
She do cocaine of a dinner plate instead of eating dinner
That shit got her getting thinner, percy money making my agenda
Nigga you pussy switchin' up your gender, you're still fuckin' bitches on Tinder
I would  smash a bitch, get top then get past to the clique
On Codeine doin' the dash in a whip
Shooter with me like Steve Nash with a clip
Smoke ass for good vibes in the air, bad bitch she strike a pose in the mirror
I know she miss me when I'm not there, miss runnin' her sluddy hands through my hair

They put me to sleep havin nightmares, fuck demons off the drugs like yeah
My percs be my strap, it's a 30 up in here
In 6 months 5 times plaque, 5 times rapper of the year
Shoutout Thug, that's my slatt
Shit is slimy over here
