Mustard on that beat, ho

Percocets be getting under my skin (Ayy, ayy)
I ain't really fucking with her friend (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
All I got is my brothers and my kin (Ayy, ayy)
Feel like LeBron how I’m all up on the rim (Woo)
Stomp 'em out in some Burberry Timbs, ayy (Woo)
I'ma come through kill him, him and him, ayy (Woo)
Money shady looking like Eminem ayy (Woo)
Niggas fake as fuck they be feminine, ayy (Woo)

Never love a ho never ever again (Right, right)
Blow a check like I blow it in the wind (Right, right)
Bad bitch finna fuck me and my friends ayy
Prolly have a ménage in the Benz, ayy (Skrt, yeah)
Two .50 Cals they be twins (Pew pew pew)
You don’t wanna see them twins working, ayy (Pew pew)
Throw a band got your bitch twerkin', ayy
Hundred thou' bought my bitch a Birkin, ayy
Put the money in the bag, stick up
I been balling like Kobe nigga no pick up
Mix the perky with the liquor magic elixir
Ten minutes later I'm fucked up
Rollie turn the summer into winter
I can turn a loser to a winner
You can't turn a chooser to a housewife
I don't act right but my Act right
I'm an activist you know I keep the pour up
Mix it with the pills and sip it till I throw up
New niggas really claiming that they know us
Pull up on 'em like what’s up, what’s up

I don't got time but my watch do
I don’t hold clips but my Glock do
I don't show no pity for a nigga running up
I gave a warning now I told that nigga not to
Choppa hit his stomach like soul food
Big kickback taught that bitch Kung fu
Peel his wig back looking like a sunroof
If you couldn't tell I do what I wanna do
Jumping in that pussy feeling like Geronimo
I go ape shit bitch I'm an animal
Bad bitch eat dick no cannibal
Got a bitch but the hoes think I'm single
I stay getting to the green like CeeLo
Brodie make the gun sing no Glee show
He'll stitch a nigga up, Lilo
He'll spark a nigga up, pre-roll
