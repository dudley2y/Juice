Ayy, Dilip

I'ma have a party tonight, go tell your friends, bitch
You ain't gettin' money, then you ain't gettin' in, bitch
Leave the heartbreak (At the crib), at the crib, bitch
Come to L.A, I can show you how I live, bitch
Bet I get her wetter wet (Wet), like a cruise ship
She been flexin' hard on my name, Terry Crews shit
No more parties in L.A. (L.A.), Kanye West shit
She do Codeine with Cocaine, that's the best shit

Think I found the love of my life (Where she at?)
In a bottle (Hey), in a bottle (Hey)
Codeine up in my Sprite (Uh-huh)
Baby bottle (Hey), baby bottle (Hey)
I'm lookin' at my future like, "Hi, hey"
You look so bright (Bling, bling)
Them VVS on my wrist so ice (Bling, bling)
But somethin' in my chest don't feel right (Yeah)
Somethin' in my chest don't feel too good (Hey)
Thought I left my heartbreak in my old hood (Hey)
Ex-bitch in my phone, up to no good (Uh-huh)
Ole gold diggin' bitch, you know you ain't gettin' no goods
I ain't really feelin' too good (Too good)
The pills make me feel too good (Uh-huh)
I know you don't want me no more (No more, ayy)
So I put my heart on the floor (On the floor), hey

I'ma have a party tonight, go tell your friends, bitch
You ain't gettin' money, then you ain't gettin' in, bitch
Leave the heartbreak (At the crib), at the crib, bitch
Come to L.A, I can show you how I live, bitch
Bet I get her wetter wet (Wet), like a cruise ship
She been flexin' hard on my name, Terry Crews shit
