Oh
Ah, ah

I don't gotta drive to do the dash (Do the dash)
Its 'cause I'm living life too fast (Skrt, skrt)
Red and purple in the Sprite can (Sprite can)
Yeah, I know that I could die like that (Like that)
Yeah, I'm down to Earth but I'm still outta space (Yeah)
My pockets on swole, woah, I'm in better shape (Woah)
She throw it back like a throwback show, Boomerang
Fuck a Four Loko, I'm on muddy drank (Drank)

I'm cooling with the goonies
Bitch, this Prada this ain't Zumiez
I think she falling for me loosely
And that Trackhawk Cherokee
My bitches wouldn't dare think to leave
I'm so blessed right now, I'm falling asleep
I got tired of putting ice in my chain
I done went and put some ice in my key
Hold up, wait, crank the Alpine
I move when I wanna, I don't check time
Give my bros a mil', this bitch can't get a damn dime
If I wasn't destined for this life then please show me a sign

I don't gotta drive to do the dash (Do the dash)
Its 'cause I'm living life too fast (Skrt, skrt)
Red and purple in the Sprite can (Sprite can)
Yeah, I know that I could die like that (Like that)
Yeah, I'm down to Earth but I'm still outta space (Yeah)
My pockets on swole, woah, I'm in better shape (Woah)
She throw it back like a throwback show, Boomerang
Fuck a Four Loko, I'm on muddy drank (Drank)

Nah, nah
Counting up the cash, I love the commas
Stepping on they necks, I'm on the come up
You fucking with my bands, you get the drama (You get it)
Just me and my gang, nigga, fuck them lame niggas
She gon' fuck on me and Boat because our chains bigger
She gon' fuck me on the boat, I'm a bad swimmer
Still dive in that cat, ooh, deep river
I'ma get her filthy drunk off the cheap liquor
I'ma tell her hunnid lies right before I dick her
Quarter million dollar car the bumper, don't do stickers
Paris fashion, we got on Balenciaga knickers (Lil Boat)

I don't gotta drive to do the dash (Do the dash)
Its 'cause I'm living life too fast (Skrt, skrt)
Red and purple in the Sprite can (Sprite can)
Yeah, I know that I could die like that (Like that)
Yeah, I'm down to Earth but I'm still outta space (Yeah)
My pockets on swole, woah, I'm in better shape (Woah)
