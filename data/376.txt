What's your name girl, what's yo' sign?
Girl you light me up, alkaline (Yeah)
Oh no, light 'em up, that ain't time

Ooh, what's your name girl (Yeah), what's yo' sign? (Brr)
Girl you light me up (Yeah), alkaline (Brr)
I could put that on (Yeah), triple nine (Brr)
You should call my phone (Yeah), triple nine (Brr)
What's your name girl (Yeah), what's yo' sign? (Brr)
Girl you light me up (Yeah), alkaline (Brr)
I could put that on (Yeah), triple nine (Brr)
Baby hit my phone (Yeah), triple nine (Brr)

Prettiest girl I've seen all my life
I forgot her name, I'm too god damn high
Time flies, now I stare every time she walks by
I feel like the guy, she's the girl
In my mind she's my world
I'll buy her diamonds and pearls
You can catch me diving in her love
She said she could be my drug
I ain't with that sober shit, I gave it up
Hennessy and Xanax got me throwing up
Mom I'm sorry, but rockstars live too gnarly

Ooh, what's your name girl (Yeah), what's yo' sign? (Brr)
Girl you light me up (Yeah), alkaline (Brr)
I could put that on (Yeah), triple nine (Brr)
You should call my phone (Yeah), triple nine (Brr)
What's your name girl (Yeah), what's yo' sign? (Brr)
Girl you light me up (Yeah), alkaline (Brr)
I could put that on (Yeah), triple nine (Brr)
Baby hit my phone (Yeah), triple nine (Brr)
