(Mustard on the beat, ho)

Every time she come around
She tell me she gon' hold it down
She said she from outta town
And she never fails to let me down, down
Every time she come around
She tell me she gone hold it down, down
She flew in from outta town
And she never fails to let me down

She live in a cocaine castle
Love the way she ride dick, no saddle
Shorty said she came from the valley
So she think everywhere else is the ghetto
Shorty really think she all that
But I don't think she all that special
Love, rock, music, and rap
I'ma do a drive by to heavy metal
I'ma do the dash, hit the pedal
Drunk drive, almost died in a lambo
She says that she wanted this forever
Ain't no such thing dumb ho
Not in my house like Mutombo
Hit her boyfriend with a combo
Burn her house down with all of the love notes
Should've never left me hurt
Bury me right in the ground
In my coffin, I won't make a sound
Now she moving to another town
Another heart hurt another love found

Every time she come around
She tell me she gon' hold it down
She said she from outta town
And she never fails to let me down, down
Every time she come around
She tell me she gone hold it down, down
She flew in from outta town
And she never fails to let me down

Bury me right in the ground
In my coffin, I won't make a sound
Now she moving to another town
Another heart hurt, another love found
Bury me right in the ground
In my coffin, I won't make a sound
Now she moving to another town
Another heart hurt, another love found

Every time she come around
She tell me she gon' hold it down
She said she from outta town
And she never fails to let me down, down
Every time she come around
She tell me she gone hold it down, down
She flew in from outta town
And she never fails to let me down

Bury me right in the ground
In my coffin, I won't make a sound
Now she moving to another town
Another heart hurt, another love found
Bury me right in the ground
In my coffin, I won't make a sound
Now she moving to another town
