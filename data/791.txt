Uh huh uh huh
My Percocets refill me 

Stacking my mind (oh yeah)
I’m in my prime (oh yeah)
Taking my time (oh yeah)
Even tho everything feels so bad , losing my mind but it’s okay it’s fine I’m just keep getting high im trynna reach new highs

There’s times where I feel alone
There’s times where I feel alone
There’s times where I feel alone
There’s times where I feel alone
There’s timеs where I feel alone
Thеre’s times where I feel alone
There’s times where I feel alone
There’s times where I feel alone

I wonder if anybody knows ?
I wonder if anybody notices when I get in my head and feel alone
Nah I don’t nobody really notices , life don’t seem so fair
Devil standing right right there fuck you
You don’t think I see you standing right there I guess I’m just too high to care well at least I found ...

There’s times where I feel alone
There’s times where I feel alone
There’s times where I feel alone
There’s times where I feel alone
There’s times where I feel alone
There’s times where I feel alone
There’s times where I feel alone
There’s times where I feel alone


Okay I get it I understand these people here to hold my hand 
But what happens when happens when I can’t comprehend
Someone holding my hand , and pour up my drank what I spent ?
5 bands bunch of pills OxyCo spend another 5 grand , I understand none these drugs make the person I am sober up I can’t sorry but I can’t I hope to see tomorrow, the potency my sorrows I was thinking hopefully praying hopefully there’s some dope for me that I could borrow
The moon shine
Triple 9 for life
