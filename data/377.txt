Uh, uh, uh (Hit-Boy)
Um

These drugs are my friends, getting sick of my friends
Lambo' truck on the way, getting sick of my Benz
Let the pills heal the pain, and then drink-drive my shame
Away, and pray I'll make it to another day
These drugs are my friends, getting sick of my friends
Lambo' truck, go away, getting sick of my Benz
Let the pills heal the pain, and then drink-drive my shame
Away, and pray I'll make it to another day

Hit the plug up so fast, he on speed dial
Withdrawals off the pills, I've been feeling senile
Feelin' like I ain't real, find the biggest building
And jump off, land on my feet, bitch, I'm chillin'
Takin' prescriptions, the Perkys make hell of a difference, yeah, yeah
This is my real life, nigga, this shit ain't scripted, yeah, yeah
Well off that substance, I got substance, bitch, I'm gifted, yeah, yeah
My tallness made me rich, now my wallet a midget, yeah, yeah
Off the drugs, in deep, I ain't even reached my peak
Off the drugs, I'm geeked, I ain't even reached my peak
Too high, can't speak, uh
I ain't even tryna be mean
Just leave me lone with my lean, let me be-e-e
I sip so much codeine, it's in my pee-ee-ee
Now I'm having them lean dreams, wake up, pour up, repeat

These drugs are my friends, getting sick of my friends
Lambo' truck on the way, getting sick of my Benz
Let the pills heal the pain, and then drink-drive my shame
Away, and pray I'll make it to another day
These drugs are my friends, getting sick of my friends
Lambo' truck on the way, getting sick of my Benz
Let the pills heal the pain, and then drink-drive my shame
Away, and pray I'll make it to another day
