 At my job do my job
While  she takin' off her top
Get  to kissin' down her neck
Off the drugs I can't stop
Wrote a phrase on her chest to forget me not

See  my name on her leg, I'ma kiss that spot
That's  forever, it's in ink, won't forget that spot
All them other hoes irrelevant
Fuck  those thots
Me and you get WiFi lit we may go fuck those thots
Forget me not

Won't forget, forget me not
Won't  forget, forget me not
Won't forget, forget me not
Won't forget, forget me not

Molly makin' the space spin
All my money on her and
All my time on her again
Hope the party never ends
Lookin' at my sins
Their pretty bad but I could do worse with a grin
Got the semi blast's I won't let them hate on me again
I be in my bag, I'ma blow the cash in the wind
She trynna run it back, I told her to throw it back again
I'm not the type 

Won't forget, forget me not
Won't forget, forget me not
Won't forget, forget me not
Won't forget, forget me not
