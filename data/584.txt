I hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long (Yeah)
I hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up (Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

Last night was a blur, so good luck was assured
If we made love or if we made something more
Last thing I remember is me walking out the door
Next thing you know woke up on the floor (Uh)
I don't know whose house this is but I know I'm in Hollywood
Scrambled for my keys then I stumbled to the car
I look in the backseat, wonder what I see
Bro passed out, laying next to a bad bride
Looks like they had a good time
I must've took off to some , I can't remember my nights
Reaching my pockets, what do I find?
Half a percocet, 200 dollars and a weed pipe
That's when somebody hit my phone line
Saying, "Yesterday was wild", asking if I'm alright
I don't know what happened, but I wanna know
I guess we gotta do it all over again tonight

I hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up

Here we go again
Woke up in a bed
But it wasn't my bed, whose is this?
Vision kinda blurry, I can't see shit
Wrapped around my body, I see two tattooed hands
Last night more blank than the night before
At least I made it to a bed, last time I woke up on the floor
Only could remember a bitch screaming, "More, more, more, more"
Videos on my phone we were in a high speed chase in a white Rolls
Looks like we threw them hands
Here's a clue, knuckles bruised and somebody elses blood on my elbow
Lately I been blacking out, drugs getting too strong
Buying all the pills from the plug, money too long
I get high to let go and find out where I belong
Probably by my Vlone
Party with my demons

I hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up

I hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up
