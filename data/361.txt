Lost in the abyss over a bitch
Damn
Lost in the abyss over a bitch

Bitch, you're done, bitch, you’re done
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
Bitch, you’re done (Uh)
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
Bitch, you're done, what have you done? (What have you done?)
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
Bitch you're done, yeah, bitch, you are done (Bitch, you are done)
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you’re done
Bitch, you’re done
I'm not the one, I’m not the one (Bitch)
I'm not the one

I will not fall inside of your abyss
I will not fall for the go-around
But what comes around
Bitch goes around
Karma's a bitch and God has a ugly frown
I know that first hand
And soon, you will too, too, too
You'll catch smoke by the second hand
The cancer is coming to you, you, you (You)

Time is up
Time is up
The time is up
The time is up
Bitch, you’re done
Bitch, you're done
Bitch, you're done
In the abyss, I'm out

Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
Bitch, you're done (Uh)
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
Bitch, you're done, what have you done? (What have you done?)
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
Bitch you're done, yeah, bitch, you are done (Bitch, you are done)
Bitch, you're done, bitch, you're done
Bitch, you're done
I'm not the one, I'm not the one (Bitch)
I'm not the one
