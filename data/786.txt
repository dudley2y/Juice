I'd do anything to mmuh uh see
You smile do anything in my power to see

I'd do anything in my power to see you just smile
I want you to prosper and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power to see you just smile
I want you to prosper and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side

Devil on my shoulder tellin' me I'll die soon
I don't really want that to impact you
But I don't know, maybe I'm just paranoid
I just want the best for you, I just want what's left of you
Oh, you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah, I pray that I get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright
Oh, you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah, I pray that I get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright

I'd do anything in my power to see you just smile
I want you to prosper and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power to see you just smile
I want you to prosper and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side

Between you and me, I think that I'm gon die soon, it's cool
I got what's coming to me, it's cool
Ain't no point running from me, it's cool
Ain't no escaping
I tried to escape it but I hate it
In my complex, in my basic
Interviews with complex, very basic, shit I hate it
The worst thing I ever did was become famous
The doctor told me I'd be dead by next June
Unless I stop all these pills I'm into
I haven't had enough, I want to double up

I'd do anything in my power to see you just smile
I want you to prosper and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power to see you just smile
I want you to prosper and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
