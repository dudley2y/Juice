Uh, anxiety is bad for the soul (Yeah)
Pills and anxiety, they take control (Y-Y-Yeah)
Anxiety is bad for the soul (Yeah)
Pills and anxiety, they take control, yeah (Yeah)
Bad timing, stars aligning (Yeah)
Lost in my abyss, please, someone find me (Oh yeah)
Bad timing, stars aligning (Oh yeah)
They don't wanna see me win, crucify the kid

Feeling terrible (Uh-huh), unbearable pain (Pain)
Lost in my head, yeah, losing my brain (Brain)
Everybody out to get me, they're abusing my brain (Brain)
Even when I do the drugs, shit don't feel the same (Same)
Uh, beautiful, uh (Uh), incredible pain (Pain)
No matter how hard I try, I can't get other people to change (Change)
Oh, she beautiful (Uh), see it through my cubicle, ayy (Ayy)
She still got a lot to learn, so do I, so it's okay (It's okay)

You ain't right all the time, neither am I
I need you by my side, right now, I feel drained (Drained)
You're the only that can convince me that I won't die
You end my movie, happily, I'm out that Nicolas Cage

Uh, anxiety is bad for the soul (Yeah)
Pills and anxiety, they take control (Y-Y-Yeah)
Anxiety is bad for the soul (Yeah)
Pills and anxiety, they take control, yeah (Yeah)
Bad timing, stars aligning (Yeah)
Lost in my abyss, please, someone find me (Oh yeah)
Bad timing, stars aligning (Oh yeah)
They don't wanna see me win, crucify the kid

Uh, uh, cross my heart, hope to die
Won't give up, I'm gon' try
My wings are made of wax
Spread them, to the sun I fly
I tell them that I feel alright, just lies
My smile is a big disguise
I may go and fuck your bitch all night, just watch
But I'm only doin' that out of spite

Uh, anxiety is bad for the soul (Yeah)
Pills and anxiety, they take control (Y-Y-Yeah)
Anxiety is bad for the soul (Yeah)
Pills and anxiety, they take control, yeah (Yeah)
Bad timing, stars aligning (Yeah)
Lost in my abyss, please, someone find me (Oh yeah)
Bad timing, stars aligning (Oh yeah)
They don't wanna see me win, crucify the kid
