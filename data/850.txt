Oh, ayy, I bet
That's my shit
This beat hard as fuck
What that nigga Blocboy say? You come Hell, hahaha
From the Chi, from the Chi, look alive
I've been working like a damn nine-to-five all my life
Put my dick in your wife
Double back, hit it twice
Run up on me, that's okay, you a pussy, get shot nine times
I'm in the cut with a super soaker, run up on me and you know it's over
All of my niggas they doin', doin' the work like they doin' homework
All of my niggas be whippin' the work
Probably selling it at church
Run up on me you get murked
I'ma put you in a hearse
Ayy, ayy, they don't understand
I got the upper hand
Poppin' like rubbеr bands
I may kill your friend, I may kill your man
Then I may just fuck you on this track let's go to Japan
I'm up in Tokyo coolin' likе Uber, everywhere
I may shoot him in broad day I never care
Look alive that shit bright, solar flare
Home run, goin', gone, it's outta here
Me and Westwood smokin' on the backwood
Pre rolled, filled it good that's a packed wood
I may just pop some perkies
I pray to god they workin'
Shit cut too deep surgeon, pull up on the scene I'll murk him
Turn to a whole different person
Flex on a bitch like Percules
Matter fact call me Hercules
Same ol' person
Fuck on that bitch, she from Taiwana
I cannot roll wood, with my marijuana
I am not with the DJ, DJ Drama
Andre with the cash, cash the commas
Look alive, please look alive
'Cause if you look too late fuck it then you may die
I'm just coolin' trap house
Skate on them niggas no black out
I ain't with the flirtin' at all, but, bitch, I got the Mac out
That shit dead Bernie Mac now
Tell them niggas to calm down
I feel like Osam now, fuck the shit I'm the bomb now
I'm just vibin' on 'em
I'm just high tryna survive—
Keep this beat goin', I fuck with this shit
Look alive, look alive
Jet lag but I still look alive, jet lag but I still look alive
I only slept for an hour, that's on the plane
But I'm still here, lit as a bitch, these niggas be lame
Run up on me then I'm snatching your life, and I'm snatching your chain, probably snatching your main
I'm kickin' this shit like, off of the brain
Half of these niggas can't do it
Half of 'em probably look stupid
Run up on me then I do it
I got my hand on my tool
I use that bitch like a toilet
Flush on that bitch, I enjoy it
I just went on a voyage, yeah, I just went on a voyage
These shoes cost your mortgage
I—
Ayy, I definitely want to drop a remix to this shit, like officially, this beat hard as fuck
Ayy, ayy, look, these shoes cost your mortgage
And these bitches imported
Pull up on the scene I'll torch 'em
Ball on them niggas full court
Whippin' in the trap no fort
I need a sport
I get some head from yo bitch 'cause I swear that bitch is a dork
Run up on him with the chopper, I swear I'ma shoot 'em for real I don't show no remorse
Nah I don't show no remorse
Shoot 'em in his head of course
That's what we aim at
That's what we bang at
Niggas switching over money that's where they change at
I cannot change over change
Bitch, I'm remaining the same
I'm screaming fuck all the games, I'll put a shot through your gang
I don't give a fuck what you say
I'm getting money all day
Ball 'til I'm bald think I need a toupee
Cross the street, the bitch go both ways
Freestyle shit no write
You couldn't pay me to write
I got a .40 on my hip like damn you niggas couldn't pay me to fight
Niggas couldn't pay me to die
Losin' too many niggas out this time
What's Juice WRLD on? That nigga probably out his mind
Well, look alive, do or die
Free my nigga, he did the time
He ain't do the crime
Don't believe me, I ain't lyin'
I ain't tellin', die
