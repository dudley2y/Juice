Oh
It woulda been a right not another wrong (Hey)

She told me that it's all my fault, it woulda been perfect all along
It woulda been a right not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, oh
'Cause it's all my fault, she would have been perfect on her own
It woulda been a right not aother wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song

She like a mouse in a mouse trap, stuck up
She got me rolling weed now, I'm fucked up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You heated too much, you're high, the summer
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you 'round momma
But you let me down, yeah, you let me drown in drama
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you 'round momma
But you let me down, you lеt me drown in drama

It woulda been perfect all along
Woulda been a right not anothеr wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, woah
'Cause it's all my fault, she would have been perfect on her own
I shoulda took a right but I took a wrong
Happy not a sad song
It's a happy not a sad song, oh
Happy not a sad song
I shoulda took a right but I took a wrong
Happy not a sad song, oh
All my fault
Swear it's all my fault

I was taking xanax, fucked up
I almost had an OD, lucked up
I'm rapping to much, cause im a singer
I'm married to money, cause my ring good
And I can't cool down
I need percs now, I need percs now
To put me out my drama

It was all my fault
It woulda been perfect all along
All my fault, It was all my fault
Took a right, shoulda took a wrong
Everything is going wrong
