Yeah, ayy

She do coke while I sip codeine
Rap game, crack game servin' to the dope fiends
She like courtside, still catch a nosebleed
9-1-1, this bitch 'bout to OD
Passed out on my couch, someone take her out
Medics in and out, tellin' her breath in and out
Neighbors nosier than a bitch, askin' me what's this about
Shorty took too many drugs, tryna overdose for clout

Molly on her tongue, got her goin' dumb
She older than me, she know that I'm young, but I'm not young and dumb
Fuck a bitch, get a bitch sprung
Pull up on the scene, they run
I pull out my gun, heater on me
Kinda like the sun, bitch, I'm not the one
Fuck with me, choppa get you smoked like a chimney
Jiminy, cricket how they jumpin' on my wave, B
It's crazy, now I'm making money on the daily
I'd be hating on me too if I wasn't gettin' paid
I'd be hating on me too if I wasn't gettin' laid
On a daily basis, on a daily basis
Presidential brain, from your main Sarah Palin
Tryna judge a nigga, you don't even got a Bailiff

She do coke while I sip codeine
