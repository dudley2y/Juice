Came in the cut with a—
Came in the but with a—
You don't wear Versace, you wear—
You don't wear Versace, you wear Versus
I don't see no competition, no versin'
I drop this perc, I'm a different person
Let's go
(Aw yeah, TyMadeIt)

You don't wear Versace, that shit Versus (That shit Versus)
I don't see no competition, ain't no versin' (Ain't no versin')
Freestyle on my songs, I don't rehearse it (I don't rehearse)
Feel like Little Wayne, 'cause I'ma just rebirth it, yеah
Chopper get to squeezin', get to squirtin' (Yеah)
Thirty round with the three-round burstin' (Yeah)
Smokin' on dope, it's potent (It's what?)
I don't got time for rats, no rodents, yeah (Time for rats)

Look at these racks (Uh-huh), in a Chanel bag (Uh-huh)
I got a gun in the bag (Uh-huh), in the Chanel bag (Uh-huh)
Five-hundred for a bag, that's a Birkin
Two-tone skelly (Uh-huh), that's the salary of a surgeon (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Where he at? Shoot his ass
Leave him leakin', yeah, maxi-pad
Ayy, pull up on him, let him have it
Gra, gra, gra, that's an automatic
Three round burst with me, I'ma let him have it
I'm ballin' like Dirk Nowitzki on the Mavericks
Want smoke? I'ma fuck around, give you cancer
I'ma pull up on the scene like a fuckin' Pamper
I can turn a nun bitch to a dirty dancer
I can turn a dumb bitch to a brain champion
I don't ever run, bitch, I ain't scared of nothin', bitch
Choppa like Nick Cannon, shoot it like a drum, bitch

You don't wear Versace, that shit Versus (That shit Versus)
I don't see no competition, ain't no versin' (Ain't no versin')
Freestyle on my songs, I don't rehearse it (I don't rehearse)
Feel like Little Wayne, 'cause I'ma just rebirth it, yeah (Yeah)
Chopper get to squeezin', get to squirtin' (Yeah)
Thirty round with the three-round burstin' (Yeah)
Smokin' on dope, it's potent (Potent)
I don't got time for rats, no rodents, yeah (Time for rats)

No time for rats, I don't got time for rats
Just time for racks, chopper shake like tourette's
Hit you in your face, and your neck, and your chest
Now you Michael Jackson, your cardiac arrest
I feel like the best, hell yeah, like the best
Metta World Peace like Ron Artest
Pull up on the scene, I tote my TEC
Matter fact, fuck it, that that bitch be jammin'
Bad bitch on my dick, best believe that I be crammin'
'Member I was broke, I was credit card scammin'
Now I'm Chris Paul with the rock I be handlin'
Choppa on my hip, it be talkin', it's ramblin'
Flexin' on these niggas like Samson
Designer on my body like a mannequin, damn
Pussy nigga you not the man, uh
Fuck nigga better man up

You don't wear Versace, that shit Versus (That shit Versus)
I don't see no competition, ain't no versin' (Ain't no versin')
Freestyle on my songs, I don't rehearse it (I don't rehearse)
Feel like Little Wayne, 'cause I'ma just rebirth it, yeah
Chopper get to squeezin', get to squirtin' (Yeah)
Thirty round with the three-round burstin' (Yeah)
Smokin' on dope, it's potent (It's what?)
I don't got time for rats, no rodents, yeah (Time for rats)
