My mama know I suffer from addiction
She like my father she hopin' I was different
But I ain't trippin' I know my sins ain't forgiven
I ain't Kodak baby I got more than tunnel vision
Broke up with the drugs but I think I need them right now
Secrets that I can't keep right now
Confessions, it's a curse and a blessing
They say your word is your weapon

My grandma probably think that I'm demonic, huh
Shit I am, let's be honest
Eyes red when I walk into the crib, ayy ayy
Die later what am I on
Mixing pills with the potions
Like a present on Christmas let me open, ayy ayy
Caught me in the open
Demons like gangsters, they catch me they gon' smoke on me
I'm in hell, I in hell
How am I, bitch, I ain't feelin' well
Can you tell? This is not a sad face
I'm having a good day, sarcastic
Pops called my phone, I was flabbergasted
'Cause I don't have no pops, I'm a bastard
And I don't have no friends
They only come around for a good time not when it matters

My mama know I suffer from addiction
She like my father she hopin' I was different
But I ain't trippin' I know my sins ain't forgiven
I ain't Kodak baby I got more than tunnel vision
Broke up with the drugs but I think I need them right now
Secrets that I can't keep right now
Confessions, it's a curse and a blessing
They say your word is your weapon

My homie told me somethin' I can't forget
