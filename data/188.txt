Got a new 9 that'll leave your mouth wide
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire
Before I leave the crib, I pray to God I won't die
I know it's hard to kill me, but I know they gon' try
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline
Get your own business and get out mine
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time
Watch them niggas around you, they playin' both sides

Boy, your gang ain't your gang and your homies, not your homies
Run it up, get that sack, but do that shit right by your lonely
Choppa hit him with a force, like I'm Obi-Wan Kenobi
Don't need no court to use my torch, I've been shootin' like I'm Kobe
I don't need nobody, I just need your body, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm gon' catch a body if you fuck with my money, ayy, ayy, ayy
Mixin' them narcotics, turned me to a zombie
Ape with a nigga, Harambe
Pull up on a nigga, no talkin'
Leave a nigga leakin', no faucet, yeah
Stand up to the opps, never back down
He'll get beat with the belt like it's SmackDown
Studio jugg life trap house, crack cocaine, my track outs
Up late night like owls, Backwoods, smokin' on White Owls
I got the lean on me right now, got a gun with a beam on me right now

Got a new 9 that'll leave your mouth wide
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire
Before I leave the crib, I pray to God I won't die
I know it's hard to kill me, but I know they gon' try
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline
Get your own business and get out mine
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time
Watch them niggas around you, they playin' both sides

Had to cut some niggas off, started seein' signs
Switchin' sides, drop and die
Tellin' lies, niggas pie
I'm a swerve with it, keep that thing on Superman
Kissin' everybody babies, shakin' all the hands (Yeah)
Everything I once achieved came from a plant (Okay)
Had to do some bad things, bitch, I'm Dirty Dan
I came a long way from high school, poppin' Xans (Facts)
I'm a 20 year old king, I own a lot of land (Facts)
My momma boujee, she wouldn't dare drive in a Land Rover (Facts)
When I'm wrong, you gettin' shot like I'm Dan Fogler
In the crib, Spike Lee drawin' on the poster
That's a throwback, she throw it back off the mimosa

Got a new 9 that'll leave your mouth wide (Lil Boat, gang)
Leave you hogtied, burnin' on a campfire (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Before I leave the crib, I pray to God I won't die (Yeah)
I know it's hard to kill me, but I know they gon' try (Yeah)
You's a pussy boy, yeah, you a feline (Pussy)
Get your own business and get out mine (I'm so blessed)
Had to kill a witness, ain't doin' no time (Gang, gang, gang)
Watch them niggas around you, they playin' both sides (Juice)
