Lyrics from Snippets

(Oh, oh)

Admire me and inspire me
I do the same thing for you, that's the irony
All these arguments are starting to get trifling
Tear drops, weed smoke, we gon' need some Visine

Uh, let me hit it, hit it
I remember the first time you let me hit it, hit it
I remember the first time that we was kissin', kissin'
Swear if you leave, I'll miss it
Baby, let's be realistic and a little optimistic
Tell me that you dying with me, and that you ridin' with me
You know that I ride with semi's, I'll give a fuck-nigga plenty
Really? Really? Really? Really?
Flexin' and fightin', that shit be silly
Go 'head and ride it just like a wheelie
Uh, really? Really? Really? Really?
Tell me are you fuckin' with me, or are you just fuckin' kidding?
Fuck ups, yeah, I had too many, still deserve a happy ending
All those drugs that I was taking, I almost had an early ending
All that shit that he was talking, I almost had an early ending
Back on point, kiss my neck while I roll this joint
Moan real loud, let me hear your voice
Together forever, won't have no choice
But I wouldn't trust me with your soul
That shit fuck around and get sold
I went platinum without trying, niggas be bustin' they ass for gold

Admire me and inspire me
I do the same thing for you, that's the irony
All these arguments are starting to get trifling
Tear drops, weed smoke, we gon' need some Visine
