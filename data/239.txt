Cardo got wings

Let me take your number down
I'm a little too high right now
I've been drinking, I've been smoking all night
Baby, I ain't tryna chase you down
Let me take your number down
I'm a little fucked up right now
I've been drinking, smoking all damn night
Baby, I ain't gonna chase you down

I ain't gonna chase
Sippin' Hennessy, I don't needa' chase
Hit the strip club, first hit Chase
Fifty hundred dollar bills from the bank
Rollin' up gas, smokin' on dank
In the club, and I saw your face
Jaw dropped, like my first mix-tape
What's your name?
Asking for that was my first mistake
In my hotel room, my heart you'll break
Lay me on the bed and my soul you'll take
Shake that ass, earth that quake
Finish it all, leave it on your face

Let me take your number down
I'm a little too high right now
I've been drinking, I've been smoking all night
Baby, I ain't tryna chase you down
Let me take your number down
I'm a little fucked up right now
I've been drinking, smoking all damn night
Baby, I ain't gonna chase you down

Yeah, my head's kinda fucked right now
But I'm still tryna fuck right now
Let me take your number down, baby
You make me calm down, baby
Come over right now, baby
Turn all the lights out, baby
Love me down, baby
I'm off the ground, baby
When you're around
You turn my frown upside down, baby
Fucked up right now

Let me take your number down
I'm a little too high right now
I've been drinking, I've been smoking all night
Baby, I ain't tryna chase you down
Let me take your number down
I'm a little fucked up right now
I've been drinking, smoking all damn night
Baby, I ain't gonna chase you down (Yeah, yeah)

Bitch, I am off of the ground
Bark at that bitch, I'm a hound
L-O-L, catch me laughing out loud
Get so high when I'm off of the ground
