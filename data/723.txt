Lyrics from Snippet
Uh, I'ma get it all, uh, uh, uh
Knock-knock, let me in, perc, no
I'm ballin' super hard like James Harden
In the fourth quarter, that's me, catch him like a taxi
Runnin' like I'm Usain, bullet better track me
Bape on my cape, I'm an animal, a monkey
Life is such a jungle so I come through like Jumanji
Hadouken, I'm Ryu with the combo
Runnin' through this shit the six with Drake in Toronto...
