Huh
DY Krazy
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, yeah

Uh, woke up on the wrong side of the bed
Uh, drugs running all through my head
And they took my brother, screamin' fuck the feds, ayy
Now I gotta keep one in the head, yeah, ayy
I was on top getting top right, uh, ayy
Rollie on my wrist, that's a stopwatch, uh
.40 on my hip, that's a big Glock, ayy
Time time will tell, tick tick tock

Blam, blaow
My watch and my gun make the same sounds
Niggas ain't in the gym but they move pounds
Nigga fuck a FN, need a .50 round
I bought all this ammo for these sorry motherfuckers
Hope they pull up 'cause I hate wasting money
Bust down, two tone skeleton AP
Okay maybe I like wasting money
Ha-ha, jokes on you
I make more money than waste
Throw 200 in the Wraith
Don't believe in the brakes
Shorty my biggest fan, I'm the reason she wakes up
Po' up, then pray to god that I still wake up (Yeah)

Uh, woke up on the wrong side of the bed
