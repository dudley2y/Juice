I miss ridin' round town with my friends
.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start nun
Cooler than the boys in the band
Color in my dreadlocks, choker on me, headlock
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay

Now we're all grown up, we all came a long way from the start
We all went the wrong way once or twice
But we can't help that shit, it's life
I miss my old friends, 'member we was doin' Xans
Up in school, the teachers said we would be in jail or dead
Now I make way more money than them
Hit up the plug, spend they rent, I bought a pint, red Hi-Tech
I miss my mom, I miss my friends, I miss my house, I miss my pet
"Laila, fetch" Mom, come to L.A., I'll get you a jet
Got off my ass and I got to a check
Feelin' sorry for the niggas who slept
Yeah, on me and my gang, 'cause we runnin' shit this year
Fuck a phone, I'm gon' hold them hundreds to my ears, ayy

I miss ridin' round town with my friends
.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start nun
Cooler than the boys in the band
Color in my dreadlocks, choker on me, headlock
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
