I ain't been this high off percys in a long time
I took two 30s and a half of a third one
I feel like I could see everything with my third eye
Feel like I've flown, see the world from a birds eye view
These drugs remind me of a girl I knew
A little sweet, a little sour and advised with the mood
Ain't no competition baby but I'm higher than you
Pray to god I never come down down down
Fuck waiting, yeah I need it right now now now
Demons want me, choppa on me, blow them down down down
New Givenchy with the Rollie flooded wow wow wow
