Taylor bout to fuckin' flex

Money is happiness, cap
Bitches got faithfulness, cap
And drugs only make it worse, cap
I take a perc, then I take me a nap
Take a sip of the syrup so I could go relax
Bitch, I'm ready for war when the demons attack
Hell yeah, believe that

One to the face, don't fuckin' hesitate
I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down
One to the face, don't fuckin' hesitate
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down (Down, down, down)
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down (Realize)
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down

Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can but you can't hide
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can
In her soul, dark and light fight for the control
Nobody knows
In her soul, dark and light fight for the control
Don't anyone know, don't anyone know

Money is happiness, cap
Bitches got faithfulness, cap
And drugs only make it worse, cap
I take a perc, then I take me a nap
Take a sip of the syrup so I could go relax
Bitch, I'm ready for war when the demons attack
Hell yeah, believe that

One to the face, don't fuckin' hesitate
I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down
One to the face, don't fuckin' hesitate
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down (Down, down, down)
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down (Realize)
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down
