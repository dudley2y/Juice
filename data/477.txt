Ayy, play your role
Play, your, role
Oh my god what is this? An L beat?

Play your role, like an actor in a movie
Roll up, let the Backwood soothe me
Loaded up, if a fuck nigga try me
She say that I'm too damn high for her liking
Play your role, like an actor in a movie
Roll up, let the Backwood soothe me
Loaded up, if a fuck nigga try me
She say that I'm too damn high for her liking

Oh my god what is this? An L beat?
Keep her checked like Nike, Shoes too pricey
Move with the tool, so the dudes won't fight me
In the groove, with the crew, so the hoes still like me
I'ma do what I do, cause my neck still icy
Whoa, keep a choker with a .45, whoa
Run up on me, you gon' die tonight, whoa
Save the drama for another time, whoa
We'll leave a nigga traumatized

Play your role, like an actor in a movie
Roll up, let the Backwood soothe me
Loaded up, if a fuck nigga try me
She say that I'm too damn high for her liking
Play your role, like an actor in a movie
Roll up, let the Backwood soothe me
Loaded up, if a fuck nigga try me
She say that I'm too damn high for her liking

And I'm too damn cool
It ain't my fault, Raf Simons on my shoes
I won't lose
Hoes gon' be hoes, bitches gon' do what they do (Oh my god what is this? An L beat?)
I hate you, and you hate me so the feeling is mutual
I got guns, and funds to do whatever the fuck I want to
These hoes tell lies, so she lyin' when she tellin' you that she bein' truthful
Go sell my drugs, or count my money bitch, make yourself useful
I think she had enough of that
So when she call me, I don't think I'm callin' back
All girls are the same, don't know how to act
So sell my drugs and make yourself useful

Play your role, like an actor in a movie
Roll up, let the Backwood soothe me
Loaded up, if a fuck nigga try me
She say that I'm too damn high for her liking
Play your role, like an actor in a movie
Roll up, let the Backwood soothe me
Loaded up, if a fuck nigga try me
She say that I'm too damn high for her liking, aye
