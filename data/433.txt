Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh
Different color pills, you know the deal
I was doing drugs before the record deal
Different color pills, you know the deal (Ah)

Different color pills, you know the deal
I was doing drugs right before the record deal
I was fighting love way before the record deal
I ain't even spend no money from my record deal
It's a new day a little over six months ago, I got a new bae
If you got some spare time, ask my ex how her life taste
I bet yo ass get blocked, ayy
I bet she's still in shock, ayy
I know she ain't forgot, ayy

But now I'm at the top with my forever love, It’s kinda like forever drugs
I'm outside off her aura
It's Dior on her face no make up you still at Sephora
These bitches wearing all this make-up that shit getting annoying and boring
I bet you when she take it off she look like Michael Jordan
I bet you when her friend take it off she looks like Ben Gordon
On Instagram she Beyoncé in real life she a Randy Orton
If I saw her on the street I wouldn’t slow up, I would floor it (Skr, skr, ugh)
Yea I got a girl but I'm speaking on behalf of my bros
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Why they gotta pick ugly hoes?
Y'all supposed to pretty though
If they knew it was catfish swimming they wouldn't fish in your city ho
Get rid of these hoes (Uh)
