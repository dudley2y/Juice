What have I done?
She don't even have a reason
Cold all four seasons (Envyion on the mix)
What have I done? What have I done?

She been poppin' pills, she don't even have a reason
Heart cold, all four seasons
Sayin' that she need me, molly in her Fiji
Now she throwin' up on my Yeezys, "Oh my god"
Lookin' at the damage, like what have I done?
Lookin' at the damn, bitch, like what are you on?
Why you look for love? When the love is all gone
(When the love is all gone)

I guess I'm supposed to be sorry
But I can not apologize for nothing, hey
I'm too busy gettin' married to the money
And I'll be damned if I let a nigga take it from me, hey
Out my lane, out my way, out my face
Can't wait, I need cake, need it right now
Don't need love, it's gon' get in the way
All this talk about love, need to pipe down
So please get away, from me
Don't hope, don't wish, don't pray for me
Just be lucky that I let you lay with me
But now you tryna stay with me

She been poppin' pills, she don't even have a reason
Heart cold, all four seasons
Sayin' that she need me, molly in her Fiji
Now she throwin' up on my Yeezys, "Oh my god"
Lookin' at the damage, like what have I done?
Lookin' at the damn, bitch, like what are you on?
Why you look for love? When the love is all gone
(When the love is all gone)

I ain't wanna do this, but I had to
I will never love you, I just wanna smash you
I don't wanna cuddle, kick you out the crib, I'll be glad too
But first, ride my dick like a saddle, Giddy up
Know you love it when I hit it deep, give you tummy tuck
Fuckin' till we go to sleep, and the sun is up
I ain't even gonna lie, got another one
And I ain't even gon' lie, that bitch prettier
So I, gotta let you go
I, never loved a ho
Why, would I love a ho
Why, I don't even know why
My hearts super cold (Ayy)
My hearts super froze (Ayy)
I can't love her no way
So I, gotta let you go
I, never loved a ho
Why, would I love a ho
Why, I don't even know why
My hearts super cold (Ayy)
My hearts super froze (Ayy)
I can't love her no way (I can't love her no way)
My hearts super froze, I can't love her no way
My hearts super cold, I can't love her no way

She been poppin' pills, she don't even have a reason
Heart cold, all four seasons
Sayin' that she need me, molly in her Fiji
Now she throwin' up on my Yeezys, "Oh my god"
Lookin' at the damage, like what have I done?
Lookin' at the damn, bitch, like what are you on?
Why you look for love? When the love is all gone
(When the love is all gone)

What have I done?
What have you done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
