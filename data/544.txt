Oh, oh, oh
Girl, I know you can't

Girl, I know you can't do it with no hands
Travel through my mind, and we can spend these bands
We can spend some time, London and France
And maybe Japan, I'm the Karate Kid
That mean I been gettin' money like I'm Jaden Smith
I'm a real one, all these other niggas counterfeit
I'ma pop some, I'm gettin' too old to throw a fist (Grra)
Brodie unloadin' the clip (Okay), took all my enemies away

'Member I was broke, reminiscin' in the kitchen (Yeah)
Auntie yellin' at me, talkin' 'bout some dirty dishes (Yeah)
Now a nigga money spendin', foreign car switchin', ayy
Don't wanna talk today, tomorrow, I'ma fuck with ya, ayy
Haha, yeah, that's me laughin' to the bank (Cha-ching)
Too many niggas want me dead, I'ma invest in a tank
Dreads in my head Shabba, Shabba, Shabba, Shabba Ranks (Gang)
Catch a K in my hands, let the choppa, choppa, choppa bang (Brr, brr)
Buy me a whip, take out the brain
Money a crip, Blueface
Send me a pic and I'ma do the rest, like LeBron James
Rockin' Ricks with a Kel-Tec and I got good aim
I can't die today, tomorrow I promised my girl we'd go on a date

Girl, I know you can't do it with no hands
Travel through my mind, and we can spend these bands
We can spend some time, London and France
And maybe Japan, I'm the Karate Kid
That mean I been gettin' money like I'm Jaden Smith
I'm a real one, all these other niggas counterfeit
I'ma pop some, I'm gettin' too old to throw a fist (Grra)
Brodie unloadin' the clip (Okay), took all my enemies away
