You say that I don't explain myself enough, so
Here's an explanation why I am the way I am
I'm drowning in my thoughts, I mix that with some wealth
And a little bit of love
A codependent nineteen year old
A codependent nineteen year old
My heart for your heart
Your heart for my soul
Ain't gon' be easy letting go, no
A codependent nineteen year old
Um, please don't run from me, you're so lovely
We both got demons, they're all ugly
We should defeat 'em, not that easy
I'm-I'm terrified, run for my life

See, it's not that easy
I'm gonna keep you just like a secret
I got some problems to work out, I need to
But it's not that easy
See, it's not that easy
I'm gonna keep you just like a secret
I got some problems to work out I need to
But it's not that easy

Your kiss and your touch has me in an abyss
My mind is in your hands
Girl, you're so powerful
You could even raise the dead
I'm living proof of it, of it

See, it's not that easy
I'm gonna keep you just like a secret
I got some problems to work out, I need to
But it's not that easy
See, it's not that easy
I'm gonna keep you just like a secret
I got some problems to work out I need to
But it's not that easy

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

See, it's not that easy
I'm gonna keep you just like a secret
I got some problems to work out, I need to
But it's not that easy
See, it's not that easy
I'm gonna keep you just like a secret
I got some problems to work out I need to
But it's not that easy
