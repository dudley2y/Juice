Uh, huh

I've been going through a lot but I just gotta stay focused
High as a bitch, off the Percs like oh shit
In too deep with this life shit, ocean
I don't got time for this stress and the commotion
I know like you know, life comes with obstacles
See it through my opticals, illusions be optical
Recently had a relationship, I think her love was optional
Ain't no way to fix the shit she did, suffer the damage, ho
We used to go by Lake Michigan to go shopping, oh
Now I'm fuckin' with a new vibe

Okay, I'm sorry, my apologies
I have no room to talk, that's hypocrisy
Okay I'm sorry-sorry, my apologies
I have no room to talk, that's hypocrisy, hey, ayy

Grateful, give me a reason to be grateful
I got a reason to be hateful
Yeah, I struggle with my hatred, how can you blame me?
I'm not tryna rain down on your parade now
But I think I'm gonna rain down on your parade
On your parade, on your parade
Grateful, give me a reason to be grateful
I got a reason to be hateful (Hateful)
I struggle with hatred, how can you blame me?

I'ma bring the pain down on you
Bring the pain down (Down)
I'ma bring the pain down on you
Bring the pain down, uh
Okay, I'm sorry, my apologies
I have no room to talk, that's hypocrisy
Okay I'm sorry-sorry, my apologies
I have no room to talk, that's hypocrisy, hey, ayy

Thankful, reason to be thankful
I've a reason to be thankful
Taught me a lot of things so, thank you, thank you
Ungrateful you had no reason to be ungrateful
All the things I did, I deserve a thank you
But all I got was an I hate you
And I could easily replace you
Well you should be thankful
This is real love, I am not a prankster
My fault, it was real love
That's in the past tense
That's where I'ma leave it
That's when I'ma leave
