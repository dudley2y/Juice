I'm at the stop
At my job, do my job
While she takin' off her top
Get to kissing down her neck
Off the drugs, I can't stop
Wrote a phrase on her chest, don't forget me not
Tat my name on her leg, imma kiss that spot
That's forever it's in ink, won't forget that spot
All them other hoes irrelevant, fuck those thots
Me & u get Wi-Fi link we make up fuck those thots

Forget me not
Won't forget, forget me not
Won't  forget, forget me not
Won't forget, forget me not
Won't forgеt, forget me not

Molly makin' the spacе spin
All my money on her end, on my tongue with her again
Hope the party never ends
Thinking about my sins, they're pretty bad but I could do worse with a grin
Got the semi blast, I won't let them hate on me again
I been in my bag, imma blow the cash in the wind
She tried to run it back, I told her to go and think again
