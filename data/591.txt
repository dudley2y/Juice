This shit real brazy (Gezin)
This that copped off the show room floor brazy
Fuck nigga

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, let's go
Woah, woah, woah, let's go

Big 'ol pointers bitin' (Diamonds)
Can't even get 'em if you like 'em (Shinin')
VVs so bright they're righteous (Diamonds)
Chains on me like Rikers (Island)
Big 'ol pointers bitin' (Diamonds)
Can't even get 'em if you like 'em (Shinin')
VVs so bright they're righteous (Diamonds)
Chains on me like Rikers (Island)

I take a pill to get hyper (Wildin')
Shit on them niggas no diaper (Wildin')
Bully them until they throw the (Towel in)
Pole will drop a nigga likе discount prices
You can see it in my smile I'm violent
But I keep it silеnt
Look at the way these niggas trying, watch him end up dyin'
Thank the lord for my .45
Bullets got to flyin'
Thank the lord that I'm still alive, keep them blessings comin'
I know it's gon' be big smoke for sure, we have to sneak the gun in
Lookin' like old money, big ol' baguette bowl money
Never ever going broke from it
Still will beat you like you stole something
Still will beat you like you owe me one
Bring the force like Obi-Wan
Stomp on your head til' you dumb like a blonde
Is that offensive? Totally not
Bitch I'm relentlessness
I put the lent in relentless because I won't give 'em a crumb

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, let's go
Woah, woah, woah, let's go

Big 'ol pointers bitin' (Diamonds)
Can't even get 'em if you like 'em (Shinin')
VVs so bright they're righteous (Diamonds)
Chains on me like Rikers (Island)
Big 'ol pointers bitin' (Diamonds)
Can't even get 'em if you like 'em (Shinin')
VVs so bright they're righteous (Diamonds)
