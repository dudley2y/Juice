With love, with love
In her abyss, in her abyss, in her abyss
In her abyss, in her abyss, in her abyss
In her abyss, in her abyss, in her abyss
With love

Vow to survive in her eyes
I'm trapped in her eyes, I'm trapped in her eyes, eyes
I'm in her abyss, ain't no coming back, ain't no coming back
I can't run, run
Oh, hopeless to bless
Both, codependent at the most, yeah
Started at the west coast, yeah
Hotel room in the lows, yeah
Ended up getting closer
Oh my god, uh
Ups and downs
I stay with you through the ups and downs
I'm not the one to fuck around
I mean business
They think that I'm a sucker, how?
This love
They think that I am falling out, with love
No, never go numb to the feeling she gives, never go
Never go numb to this feeling I feel, never go
Never go numb to the feeling she gives, never go
Never go numb to the feeling I feel, yeah

In her abyss, with love
In her abyss, in her abyss, in her abyss
In her abyss, in her abyss, in her abyss
