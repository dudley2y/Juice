Lyrics from Snippets

Cheers
Sippin' codeine like it's beer
I'm in London so I'm screaming, "Cheers"

Man of the year, still got problems
Lookin' in the mirror, you look awful
Talkin' to myself, do it too often
JK, Juice WRLD, you're so awesome
Um, running up funds
Bottle full of pills, let's have fun
No cheap thrills, only rich ones
Fire drills, hotter than the sun
They say life's a puzzle, well I'ma piece it together
But from the way I'm movin', I'll probably be piecing forever
I date a bad bitch, she'll be over decent forever
Even with fake tits, these other hoes just decent forever
My lady said she saw a baddie in the hotel lobby
Well love, let's fuck her together
We got the world to our backs, give a fuck, never have
Middle fingers up, we're screaming fuck 'em forever

Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know my lyrics saved you
Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped you break through

Buzzin' like I'm light year, infinity and beyond
Big headed, in my mind, I'm always thinking of songs
Big dick too, probably won't fit in your mom
I met my shorty thick, that's the type of shit that I'm on
I got to admit it, she helped me found where I belong
Stay down with me through all of my rights and my wrongs
Now it's me and her together a lifelong
Lock her heart up like the key, she ain't finna make one

My ups and downs, I'll drive them down
In London town, cheers to the golden years
My ups and downs, I'll drive them down
In London town, cheers to the golden years

Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know my lyrics saved you
Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped you break through
