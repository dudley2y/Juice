Make her cry, cry, cry, she need tissue
I get high, high, high, and have no issue
VVS on me, no igloo
You say you fly, but we been flew
Ahh, ahh, ah
I told that bitch it ain't no way around it like Future
Come to find out, yesterday she was fuckin’ on Future
Stripper bitches callin' on my phone
They wanna know when I'll show up to the club
'Cause I throw hunnids in that bitch, ain't throwin' dubs
Spend a check, oh, money love
Designer clothes, designer hoes, designer drugs
50 K for the Birkin bag, did it just because
I'm in Chicago where they drill, drill, drill, drill
No Limit gang with me, yeah they real, real, real, real
FBG up in here, Future real, real, real, real
Perky pop, love the pills, mix it with Klonopins
She wanna kick it, she know judo
I cannot save her, I’m not a hero
Bank account commas and zeros
Gucci, Amiri, my apparel
Keep a pistol, let it hit ya, I'm official
Fuck that bitch
I will not kiss her, I won't miss her
Make her cry, cry, cry, she need tissue
I get high, high, high, and have no issue
VVS on me, no igloo
You say you fly, but we been flew
Ahh, ahh, ah
I told that bitch it ain't no way around it like Future

You say you fly, we been flew (Ah-aah)
