We was just talkin' 'bout some shit, yeah
Girl, you don't, you don't, you don't
Yeah, you don't, you don't, you don't

You don't know me like you think you know me
Say you love me, baby girl, then show me
Arguments, all you do is blow me
But when you leave I'm so fuckin' lonely

I walk, walk away, away from all my problems
I look, look at you, look at you to solve 'em
Now I see, now I see, that is the problem
Co-dependence, not independent
Now I see, now I see, I see through the darkness
Climbing out of the hole which I fall in
Finding peace in a world full of sorrow
I'll try, I'll try

Love, live let her go
Fuck that, hold her close
Do I get high off her love
Or just perky overdose?
All of those options are tempting
Still, wish we were never-ending

You don't know me like you think you know me
Say you love me, baby girl, then show me
Arguments all you do is blow me
But when you leave I'm so fuckin' lonely
You don't know me like you think you know me
Say you love me, baby girl, then show me
Arguments all you do is blow me
But when you leave, when you leave

Oh oh oh, oh oh
This ain't heaven, this hell with a smile
Oh oh, oh oh
I'll sit down, this may take a while

Hold my hand, yeah yeah yeah, and don't give up on us
Got a fire a desire I got love fever
Let us dance, yeah yeah yeah, I'm the devil in a tux
But you're the one with all the fire
Love, live let her go
Fuck that, hold her close
Do I get high off her love
Or just perky overdose?
All of those options are tempting
Still, wish we were never-ending

You don't know me like you think you know me
Say you love me, baby girl, then show me
Arguments all you do is blow me
But when you leave I'm so fuckin' lonely
You don't know me like you think you know me
Say you love me, baby girl, then show me
Arguments all you do is blow me
But when you leave, when you leave

Oh oh oh, oh oh
This ain't heaven, this hell with a smile (This ain't heaven, this hell)
Oh oh, oh oh
I'll sit down, this may take a while
