Tay Keith fuck these niggas up

Yeah my pockets facetious
Hang with them killers, they'll do it for no reason
Shoot a fuck nigga, Gilbert Arenas
I'm at the W, I'm at the Lowe, you at four seasons
Swervo almost crashed the Bentley truck, tweakin'
Me, I just crashed in your bitch for the weekend
Me, I just crashed in a bad Puerto Rican
Your bitch only decent
I fuck her once, won't run it back, that bitch is not a remix

I done got rich overnight, I don't know how to act (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
If I wasn't rappin' then I would be flippin' the packs (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Last week I spent 10K all in Sach's (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's a fact, 'cause I know I'm gon' make that shit right back (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
AP two tone Skelly-Skelly, Lamborghini money-money
You ain't got no money, why you frontin' like you doin' somethin'?
I took a piss on your brother grave, how come y'all niggas ain't doin' nothin'?
If I was you I would kill me, but knowin' me I ain't goin', nah
If I don't got it on me, best believe my broddie got it, he be pistol tottin'
Two Perc 30’s in my system, ain't no ibuprofen
Nigga fuck your rollie, AP on me
Try to take it, we gon' beat 'em like he stole it

Yeah my pockets facetious
Hang with them killers, they'll do it for no reason

Did my shit in the street already, so I gotta play defense
Say you nervous, for no reason, and the nigga breathin'
I got shot but I still shot a nigga, I was gettin' even
His blood all on my DnG, I gotta tuck my sleeves in
Rush a brick would've sell my back with a pack, that's when I start the treason
You want me to stay and I had enough of you, fuck it I'm leavin'
I ain't tryna be in the house, bitch, it's the fuckin' weekend
Puerto Rican off me, think I'm gon' fuck over you breathin'
Bitch you can keep on smellin', I be keepin' hella of this weed in
My jeans match the Margielas, I rock Balencia better
G Fazo et cetera
Do no Off-White kicks unless them bitches match my sweater so
Rockin' Balenci' briefs, the bitches grip my Glock like Atticus
I'm  bosses, hatin' pussy that ain't proper etiquette
Call you pussy niggas Ray J, 'cause your life is edited-ed
On the net think you a gangsta just because you animate shit
In real life we handle this shit

Yeah my pockets facetious
Hang with them killers, they'll do it for no reason
Shoot a fuck nigga, Gilbert Arenas
I'm at the W, I'm at the Lowe, you at four seasons
