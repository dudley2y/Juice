Nine, nine, nine
Sometimes I feel different (Oh, woah)
Ayy, he don't want no problems unless he got bitches (Oh, woah)
Okay, uh (Uh, uh)
Really feel myself but sometimes I feel different (Sometimes I feel different)
I'm feelin' myself but sometimes I feel different (Sometimes I feel different)
Always been myself but sometimes I feel different (Sometimes I feel different)
Uh, uh, ooh woah

I always been myself but sometimes I feel different (Ooh woah)
I got it all but it feel like it's something missing (Ooh woah)
I came a long way from skipping school and smoking Swishers  (Ooh woah)
Used to keep a .40 that'll clean a nigga dirty dishes (Ooh woah)
Now I got a gun that'll beam 'em up like Scotty did it (Ooh woah)
Banana clip’ll go and eat 'em up, over the monkey business (Ooh woah)
She tell me that she'll do whatever I want, she just wanna be with me (Ooh woah)
I told her I don't want none of the fake love she try to give me

I don't want it, I don't want it
But I never run and my heart tougher than bricks
Okay it's not tougher than bricks
Actually it's brittle as shit
But me admitting that to you, was about as tough as it gets
She told me that she love me
She think I'm gon' fuck her for it
Every girl tell me she love me
I ain't finna fuck 'em for it
But since we on the topic of discussion, go ahead and fuck my boys
And you ain't fucking 'em right, if you ain't in the room makin' noise
I met this ho today on a boat and frankly I'm still annoyed
I'm tryna enjoy the water and this bitch was makin' me feel annoyed
She almost fought my girl
Almost got beat up like my girl a boy
That's the end of my daily story, I'm gon' make you pay me for it
Oh-oh-oh
Time is such a great thing
It gives you the chance to wipe the slate clean
Percs have my brain weak
I cried hard this evening
Keep the feelings
We may die this evening

I always been myself but sometimes I feel different (Ooh woah)
I got it all but it feel like it's something missing (Ooh woah)
I came a long way from skipping school and smoking Swishers  (Ooh woah)
Used to keep a .40 that'll clean a nigga dirty dishes (Ooh woah)
Now I got a gun that'll beam 'em up like Scotty did it (Ooh woah)
Banana clip’ll go and eat 'em up, over the monkey business (Ooh woah)
She tell me that she'll do whatever I want, she just wanna be with me (Ooh woah)
I told her I don't want none of the fake love she try to give me

I see it, all like I'm omniscient
Sometimes I can't see it all, I ain't omniscient
Time to leave, "Bon voyage", nigga, good riddance
I wrap cement around his leg, it's time to go fishing
Get high as fuck, no comin' down (Uh-uh)
I really need to calm down (Uh-uh)
These Percocet get me signed out (Uh-uh)
They may knock my lights out (Uh-uh)
They pipe me up and pipe down (Uh-uh)
To the plane, need a time out (Uh-uh)
They say you fuck my mans (Uh-uh)
Baby don't let me find out (Uh-uh)
This ain't a rental, I hop in the Lambo and drive like a criminal
I'm gettin' more bread than a basket of dinner rolls
Dead rose, I ball out like Derrick Rose
I just spent 20K on Melrose
Came a long way from wearing shell toes
Diamonds on me and they wetter than water
Speakin' of water I'm fresh off a sailboat
I've been up in my matrix
I've been gettin' high, faded
Blue pills take me to different places
Rearrangin', screwin' my brain in

I always been myself but sometimes I feel different (Ooh woah)
I got it all but it feel like it's something missing (Ooh woah)
I came a long way from skipping school and smoking Swishers  (Ooh woah)
Used to keep a .40 that'll clean a nigga dirty dishes (Ooh woah)
Now I got a gun that'll beam 'em up like Scotty did it (Ooh woah)
Banana clip’ll go and eat 'em up, over the monkey business (Ooh woah)
She tell me that she'll do whatever I want, she just wanna be with me (Ooh woah)
I told her I don't want none of the fake love she try to give me
