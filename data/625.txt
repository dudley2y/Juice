I'm too official
Ayy Herb
I'm too official

I'm smokin' on Chronic, out my body
Thumbin' through a check, wildin'
Get in the way, you get wrecked
Put away money and burn all the rest
Up for days, I ain't get no rest
It's just me and this Kel-Tec
Back in the day, Trueys and J's
Criminal ways, droppin' them sets

Mm, mm, mm
They don't got no choice but to respect it
If they don't then I'm gon' teach they ass a lesson
We can fight or I can go get the Smith & Wesson, uh
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Terry Crews, me and my crew, we woke up flexin'
One hundred in cash, I don't do no credit or debit
On yo' ass, bro, aimin' steady-eady, uh
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Bitch, I'm a dog, I don't got no heart, feel like Belly, uh
I take a piss on my enemies, I'm young R. Kelly, uh
I take a shit on my enemies, they broke and smelly, uh
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
NLMB one-fifty, bitch, know we war ready, uh

Before rap, nigga, been war ready
On the block, Glock 2-3 on my pallet
I was tryna move, like  off 
I ain't never want no two, I'ma sell it
War was in-evident
We did it better than niggas ahead of us
Ain't leave no evidence
You is irrelevant
Shots goin' off in the hood
Niggas steppin' up, you wasn't never there
 thirty shots out my 
Coke in the esse's trap, I left my sweater there
Mama sent me to my uncle when I was broke
Went back to Essex 'cause I like it better there, uh
I was a troubled teen
Kept two cups, was a double fiend
Tote this pipe to protect myself
But a nigga disrespect, that's another thing
Fuck nigga a snake, I don't trust a thing
Only did shit my brother seen
AR shots like thunder singing
EBK, what the fuckin' meaning?

I'm smokin' on Chronic, out my body
Thumbin' through a check, wildin'
Get in the way, you get wrecked
Put away money and burn all the rest
Up for days, I ain't get no rest
It's just me and this Kel-Tec
Back in the day, Trueys and J's
Criminal ways, droppin' them sets
I'm smokin' on Chronic, out my body
