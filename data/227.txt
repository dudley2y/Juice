Your ex made a mistake when he left you
'Cause now we on a level he can't get to
This is me tryna tell you that you're special
Honestly, I want this shit forever
I know these other niggas tryna press you, finesse you
I promise that I'm only tryna respect, not neglect you
Let's go back to the crib, wan' undress you, caress you
Got a nigga blessed like, "Achoo"

God damn, your hand inside my hand
Can't focus, need adderral or vyvanse (Huh, ayy)
I feel like a doctor
You got my head spinning like a helicopter
You got my heart racin', speed racer
She really hold me down, team player
If you try to take her, .40 with a laser
Only one of her so I know cannot replace her
I don't ever sleep, I always wait for her to wake up
First thing that I tell her is she pretty with no makeup
