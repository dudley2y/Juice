D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

Baby, I can't lie, you look amazing
Like the models in my Playboy pages
Flashback to my immature stages
I done glowed up, I done growed up
I didn't have a lot of words for the ladies
But they knew I stayed dressed in the latest
Now, I got more game than the players
I done glowed up, I done growed up

She tell me that I'm goin' through the motions
'Cause I ain't ever showin' no emotions
Ayy, I tell her, "It's over, it's over"
I done glowed up, I done growed up
I'm goin' through the motions
She hate it when I'm goin' through the motions
I said, "It's over, it's over, it's over"
She's on my phone lookin' for closure
I hate when I'm goin' through the motions
'Cause I ain't ever showin' no emotions
I tell her, "It's over, it's over"
I done glowed up, I done growed up
