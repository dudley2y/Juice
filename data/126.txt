Um, life's
Oh

Life’s a dungeon, chase the dragon
Slayin' everything in my path (Ayy)
Walk through blood, sweat, tears in my Rafs (Hey)
Enjoy your time, you can't get it back (Hey)
Life’s a dungeon, chase the dragon
Slayin' everything in my path (Ayy)
Walk through blood, sweat, tears in my Rafs (Hey)
Enjoy your time, you can't get it back (Hey)

I'm in the lost and found
All I see is black fire when I walk around
So I try to get higher, just to calm me down
'Til I end up too high, it make me crack a frown
R.I.P. to my dad, I hope I see you in heaven
I hate you for dying before I could fix this
But I love you for making me, you made a legend
Your son is a king, knew I wasn't gon' be a peasant
But I'ma do my thing, I’ma do my thing
While you look down on me, I’ma get the green
Make it rain, word to Rihanna
They gonna need an Umbrella-ella-ella, ayy
Demons I've been beating
I’ve been fighting hella, hella, ayy

Life's a dungeon, chase the dragon
Slayin' everything in my path (Ayy)
Walk through blood, sweat, tears in my Rafs (Hey)
Enjoy your time, you can't get it back (Hey)
Life’s a dungeon, chase the dragon
Slayin' everything in my path (Ayy)
Walk through blood, sweat, tears in my Rafs (Hey)
Enjoy your time, you can't get it back (Hey)

Life's a luncheon with no food
Been stayin' to myself, I ain't tryna come off rude
And prayin' to myself for my health and my boo
But three words for her, ayy, baby, I love you
Losing my head, feel like I'm walking to my doom
Touching my dreads, nervous when I walk in the room
You happy talking to me, not happy talking to you
Hate interactions, conversating prolly nothin' to you
I put them sunglasses on and put them pills in my stomach
Then blow that kush, my cologne, crack the seal, yeah, I'm on it
Now I'm ready for the public, I can't feel nothin'
In my mind, stuck in, that's that place, sunken, oh
Sunken in a pit, sunken, my abyss, sunken
What I learned from it? I don't know, but my diamonds still frozen
I'm still chosen, just gotta stay focused

Life's a dungeon, chase the dragon
Slayin' everything in my path (Ayy)
Walk through blood, sweat, tears in my Rafs (Hey)
Enjoy your time, you can't get it back (Hey)
Life's a dungeon, chase the dragon
Slayin' everything in my path (Ayy)
Walk through blood, sweat, tears in my Rafs (Hey)
Enjoy your time, you can't get it back (Hey)
