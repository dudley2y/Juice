Ah, look
I got my family in the booth with me
Man, it's Peter, Frank, Tiko, Jamie, Brandon, my nigga Zay, you feel me? Haha
Man, I'm just a young fly nigga
But, this for the people people who say I can't rap, like I got them bars, uh

Now these xans got me tweakin'
Fuck it, I'ma pop a few more and get to sleepin'
Hoes on my dick, got her wet, shorty leakin'
I'ma fuck her on the weekend while I'm listenin' to Weeknd
Damn, I'm swimmin' through this money, on the deep end
You run up on me, that's okay, you drownin' on the deep end
That four-five hit 'em, make his head fall apart
Boy, your girl givin' brain, but that bitch never smart
I finessed her, life is just a blessing
Got my hand toted on that fuckin' Smith and Wesson
If I catch him, I'ma kill him and teach his ass a lesson
I shoot a motherfucker if I ever feel threatened
So I never feel threatened, and then the pain lessens
I'ma pop drugs, they my teachers, that's the lesson
Mix 'em with the water, make 'em disappear
Magic trick, Harry Potter when a nigga reappear
In the kitchen, water whippin', can you relate, nigga?
Are you early to the party? Are you late, nigga?
Run up on me, that's okay, you get baked, nigga
I get to cookin' motherfuckers, soufflé, nigga
I got the beats on this beat, Dr. Dre, nigga
In the club drunk, that's that fuckin' Alize, nigga
Shout out to Zay, nigga, we some alcoholics
We some ball-a-holics, I'ma ball until I die
Ball until I'm fallin', I should be signed to Spalding
Niggas talkin' stupid 'til I run in his apartment
I been selling drugs like they ship to what department?
Store niggas talkin' shit 'til I run up and kill them
More, make a body flip like parkour
Then again I'm tryna fuck the world, no hard porn
Niggas talkin' that shit 'til a body get torn apart
Damn right, I'm that man, please don't get me started
Kickin' bitches out the crib, they compare me to Martin
I may pull up in that Aston and mixed with the Martin
Niggas talkin' hella shit 'til I run up and spark 'em
Iron on my hip, they compare me to Tony Stark
'Cause I'm Tony Stark and back to the books
They say I'm Noah's Ark and the Rosa Park and damn right
Niggas know I'm goin' crazy, do this shit all night
Motherfuckers talkin' stupid, boy, long flight
'Cause I swear I'm fly forever
Yeah, I swear I'm fly forever
Wrist so cold, it could change the weather
I hope you're prepared for a blizzy summer
Look, uh
Now I'ma let the glizzy shoot
I don't give a fuck what a pussy nigga do
Run up on me, I'ma hang him, somebody hand me the noose
I am sick of all this truce, I want the war, fuck a truce
Superman up in this booth, I don't even need a cape
I'm just tryna fuck the world, they accusin' me of rape
Run up on me, I'ma kill 'em, put the pistol to your face
I ain't talkin' 'bout a pencil but I leave his ass erased, okay
I'm coolin' with my guys more than usual
Niggas talkin' stupid but I'll mix you like a Rubix cube
I'm smart with this rap shit and you a dumb nigga
Shoot you in your chest a few times, I'm a numb nigga, uh
Yeah, this shit is painless, umbrella for the club, I'm on that rain shit
Window pane shit, out the crib Martin Payne shit
Bitches painless, run up on you with that TEC, bitch
I'm in a tank like Master Pete
Picasso on the track, I'ma spit a master piece
I'ma slave, so hold on, would a master please
Come and take these gold diamond chains off of me? Huh
