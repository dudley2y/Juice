Oh, hope my lullabies get under her skin
Like the itch from the Percs on a binge
She ballin' out her eyes from the bench
She tell me that she'll never play love games again
Whoa, hope my lullabies get under her skin
Like the itch from the Percs on a binge
She's ballin' her eyes out from the bench

She don't got no choice, she resort to the benzos
Every day she live and die for benzos
New drug dealer, what's his info?
Her plus heartbreak equals Xans
Need a new equation, she gonna die tryna do the math
Suicidal tendencies, she hopin' that they end it fast
Fentanyl in a Fendi bag, she don't even smoke the gas
She been sleep for three days, cutting up, missing class
Teacher called, asked what's wrong
Slurrin' back, you say he gone
Runnin' out of downers, you look down at your dresser
You see a 8 ball of all pure Colombian pleasure
It was left by that dude you tried to fuck to forget me
You snort a line and rail a Perc to see which one is better
Walkin' 'round in your mind picking up my belongings
I got a lot of shit here, it's been taking forever
Walkin' 'round in your heart with some fuel and some fire
The same fire tatted on me heart destroyer forever goodbye

Oh, hope my lullabies get under her skin
Like the itch from the Percs on a binge
She ballin' out her eyes from the bench
She tell me that she'll never play love games again
Whoa, hope my lullabies get under her skin
Like the itch from the Percs on a binge
Oh, she ballin' her eyes out from the bench

She don't got no choice, she resorts to the gossip
Always in my business, wondering what I'm sipping
And how I'm living, a lot of things are different
You not being here is what I was missing
Feel like I'm in a heaven house, still pour up in a Hell's Kitchen
In Chicago makin' heartbreak songs, eatin' on some hell's chicken
Miami calling me, oh-oh, them calls I'm missin'
I'm calling the ambulance, oh-oh, the thought of you was sickenin', sickenin', sickenin'
Trippin', sip-sippin', 3-6 in a cup like it's Memphis
Oh I'm drippin', new girl got hoes, she pimpin'
We got hoes, we share 'em, get it
Make her eat you out, bitch get it
This ho think she been on my mind quit it
Unlike her, I know how to mind business

Ohh-oh-oh, lullabies in your dome spread insanity through your soul
Rock-a-bye baby, are you ready to die?

Oh, hope my lullabies get under her skin
Like the itch from the Percs on a binge
She ballin' out her eyes from the bench
She tell me that she'll never play love games again
Whoa, hope my lullabies get under her skin
Like the itch from the Percs on a binge
Oh, she ballin' her eyes out from the bench
She don't got no choice, she resorts to the

Ohh-oh-oh, lullabies in your dome spread insanity through your soul
Rock-a-bye baby, are you ready to die?
Lullabies in your dome spread insanity through your soul
Rock-a-bye baby, are you ready to die?
