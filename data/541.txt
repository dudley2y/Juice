And it's fuck it
I don't got time anymore
Left my heart on the floor
So I don't got mine anymore (Hi Kevin)
If she hate it, I love it
I don't got time anymore
She said, "Fuck it," then it's fuck it
I don't got time anymore

She said, "Fuck it" then it's fuck it
I don't got time anymore
Left my heart on the floor
So I don't got mine anymore, ayy
She said "Fuck it," then it's fuck it
Can't waste my time anymore
Left my heart on the floor
So I don't got mine anymore

If she hate it, I love it
We not the same no more
All girls the same, lil' whores
Copped the Porsche truck, that's a high horse
Kick you out the car like, "Fuck it"
Don't need your love anymore
I left your shit at the door
You threw my heart on the floor, fuck it
Here we go, here we go
I don't got love, not for a ho
I do what I want, 'cause I say so
Fuck love, I just want Pesos
Here we go, here we go
I wasn't the same like a year ago
I fell in love and fell out of love
What you call that shit? A miracle
Oh, fuck it
Keep your heart, I don't want it
I told you bitch, I could care less
Can you not tell by the chorus?

She said, "Fuck it" then it's fuck it
I don't got time anymore
Left my heart on the floor
So I don't got mine anymore, ayy
She said, "Fuck it" then it's fuck it
Can't waste my time anymore
Left my heart on the floor
So I don't got mine anymore

Yeah, I said, "Fuck it"
Raw dog a bitch, no rubber, yeah
This a love story from the gutter
Just to show the bitch that I don't love her, fuck it
I fell out of love, I feel like a beast ho
Going out of my mind, no peace ho, no sleep ho
I gotta smoke two blunts just to eat ho, fuck it
Now I'm givin' my heart to these freak hoes
'Cause the shots goin' in like free throws
And she knows
I just wanna fuck it for the night, woah-woah, woah-woah


Now I'm finna spazz
Now I get two killers on your ass
Leave you in the past, I'm goin' hard
It never last, leave a nigga leakin'
No maxi pad
Fuck it, pull up on you and I buss it
All of my niggas get money
I keep on rockin', Givenchy
Miss me when I'm gone
Feel like Drake, nigga
'Cause I started from the bottom
And they hate niggas
All these fake niggas
You ain't eatin' good, you should grab a plate, nigga
Ayy, pull up on the scene with my Glock on me
Only need myself ain't no homies
