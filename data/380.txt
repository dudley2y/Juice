Baby I'm just fucking you, you know you get no love from me
Fuck nigga ran up (Yeah), thank God I had my gun on me

I don't love you, I just love on your body
I kick that shit like I'm doing karate
Gun'll stretch you out, my choppa Pilates
Fuck with my money I catch me a body
I'm in the studio don't do parts
Put your guns in the air nigga let's get gnarly
Suck me good, let's get naughty
Bitch it's on, bitch it's popping
Bitch it's cracking, bitch it's bracking
You niggas ain't 'bout that action
My hand stay on my ratchet
I grew up really trapping
Ran up the money, ran up the bag
You niggas all in my way
I'm in my prime, I'm in my bag
None of you niggas are fucking with me
Perc 3-0 to the face

Single ladies stand up like Beyoncé
Finger fuck 45 for the foreplay

Want some smoke then we get your ass cancer quick
Choppa hit your chest bullets cancerous
Mama mad at me I'm smoking cancer sticks

Life is hard to swallow take a pill with it
Depression on my shoulder but I live with it

Snakes in the grass, anaconda yeah
Feel like Drake or some- cause I started from the bottom yeah
