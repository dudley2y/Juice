I make it to the fight on the dot
Sweep you and beat you like a mop
Drippin and droppin we off
He ask me why I scoff
I tell him shut up you a bot
Ballin, we keeping it one hundred
People tryna catch me I be runnin
Boy what you tryna do
Removed him a military coupe
Ice on my neck I feel happy
Beat him at the mosque, Zaki
Sword in my hand, I be jabbin
I still got some boys in the trip
If I got the shot Ima take it
Don't tell me that I don't face it
We really like the power
Maybe stop acting like a coward
Official business with the boys
I use you likе a toy
All of it give me joy
Why you always annoy
You always try to surround me
Traps don't work in this country
Thеn I pull the bounty
I just really wanna see how you cry
Army style I'm always dry
Run him over in the benz oh my
