Love don't love me
Bitch I know
But the drugs still love me
That's for sure
She fell in love with a junkie, gettin' the dough
Fuck her one time, then show her to the door
Everything she said, I heard it all before
I see all these demons, they disguised as whores
All I know is count the money up from the floor
If the pussy good, I may just go get some more, more

Say she want my heart, she can't afford it
Maybe cause I'm on my way to getting on the Forbes list
Pretty jiggy nigga, can't ignore it
Ballin', bitch, I feel like Michael Jordan
Sip codeine, I'm snorin'
Til' the mornin'
Got the heater on my hip like global warming
Run up, you get shot, this is a warnin'
Freddy Krueger in your dreams, I'm filled with torment
She say that she love me, bitch, whatever that means
I remember her and all her friends were laughin' at me
Now they tell me I can fuck, that shit so funny to me
Lost ten thousand playin' basketball, one hundred to me

Love don't love me
Bitch I know
But the drugs still love me
That's for sure
She fell in love with a junkie, gettin' the dough
Fuck her one time, then show her to the door
Everything she said, I heard it all before
I see all these demons, they disguised as whores
All I know is count the money up from the floor
If the pussy good, I may just go get some more, more
