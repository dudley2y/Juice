Yeah (Ayy)

She do coke while I sip codeine
Rap game, crack game, serve it to the dope fiend
She like courtside, still catchin' nosebleed
9-1-1, this bitch 'bouta OD
Passed out on my couch, someone take her out
Medics in 'n out, tellin' her, "Breathe in 'n out"
Neighbors nosier than a bitch, askin' me, "What this about?"
Shorty took too many drugs, tryna overdose for clout

Uh, molly on her tongue got her goin' dumb
She older than me, she know that I'm young
But I'm not young and dumb
Fuck a bitch, get a bitch sprung
Pull up on a scene, they run
I pull out my gun, heater on me
Kinda like the sun, bitch I'm not the one
Fuck wit' me, choppa give you smoke like a chimney
Jiminy Cricket, how they jumpin' on my wave, B
It's crazy, now I'm makin' money on the daily
I'd be hatin' on me too if I wasn't gettin' paid, uh
I'd be hatin' on me too if I wasn't gettin' laid, uh
On a daily basis, on a daily basis
Presidential brain from your main, Sarah Palin
Tryna judge a nigga, you don't even got a bailiff
