"Ayy, turn the music up for me, Chris!"
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
I found my closure, lost my composure
High 'til it's over, ain't over 'til it's over

Count the winnings (Huh, yeah), fuck up out your feelings (Yeah)
Get to the millions (Huh, yeah), fuck up out your feelings (Yeah)
Dawg these bitches (Huh, ya dig), fuck up out your feelings (Yeah)
And don't forget to get high (Huh), live life with no ceilings (Yeah)
Getting high to get by, watch my friends die (Uh, huh)
See 'em in the distance (Damn), you gotta be kidding (Damn)
Getting high to get by, watch my friends die (Huh)
See 'em in the distance (Damn), you gotta be kidding (Uh)

The world's gettin' colder, friends die young
Don't believe in older, they all die young
My heartbeat is slower, codeine sipper
No, I'm not a poser, I'm a power tripper
Yeah, I got so high that I ain't never come back
Yeah, I ran the train to get her on the right track, yeah
That's your bitch? Nigga, how do you like that?
Don't worry 'bout it, we'll send her right back

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woah, woah, woah, just got that colder
The world on my shoulders
I'll keep my composure
Just to find some closure

Count the winnings (Huh, yeah), fuck up out your feelings (Yeah)
Get to the millions (Huh, yeah), fuck up out your feelings (Yeah)
Dawg these bitches (Huh, ya dig), fuck up out your feelings (Yeah)
And don't forget to get high (Huh), live life with no ceilings (Yeah)
Getting high to get by, watch my friends die (Uh, huh)
See 'em in the distance (Damn), you gotta be kidding (Damn)
Getting high to get by, watch my friends die (Huh)
See 'em in the distance (Damn), you gotta be kidding (Uh)

Yeah, this gon' be a hard pill to swallow
But you may not live to see tomorrow
So don't just sit here in your sorrows
Look for some happiness, here, you could borrow some
And here goes some Codeine, it cost a car note
Don't sip it and drive, you'll crash the Murci√©lago
Then you may die before sunrise
That mean you ain't live to see tomorrow, I said so

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woah, woah, woah, just got that colder
The world on my shoulders
I'll keep my composure
Just to find some closure

Count the winnings (Huh, yeah), fuck up out your feelings (Yeah)

Dawg these bitches (Huh, ya dig), fuck up out your feelings (Yeah)

Getting high to get by, watch my friends die (Huh)
See 'em in the distance (Damn), you gotta be kidding (Uh)
