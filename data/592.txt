Lyrics from Snippets

(Wheezy outta here)
Them go
Gas in the
Gas in the foreign, let's go
Gas in the foreign, let's go
Probably playin' that Beast Mode
Wi-Fi lit on you hoes
Mr. 999, fuck the pole, yeah

Racks in my Amiris, I barely can walk
All about action, bitch, no talk
I ain't with the cappin' shit at all
I take two percs to wrap 'em off
Take two more, then I fuck 'em off
Get Rick Owens to fuck it up
Uh, buy it all, yeah, yeah, buy it all
Real gang shit, no fakes at all
Uh, No Limit, we taking over all
Uh, give me good head, no teeth at all, uh
