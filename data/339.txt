Prettiest girl I seen all my life
I forgot her name, I'm too goddamn high
Time flies, now I stare every time she walks by
I feel like the guy, she's the girl
In my mind, she's my world
I'll buy her diamonds and pearls
You can catch me diving in her love
She says she can be my drug
I ain't with that sober shit I gave it up
Hennessy and Xanax got me throwing up
Mom, I'm sorry, but rockstars live too gnarly
