You know that is my time, hoe
Life is money so I got a dime for it
Man, I see it but my shades strong
This Gucci on my face it help me dap on ‘em
You know we stay smoking on that indo
That Travis Scott antidote
But don’t call me a random
Pullin’ up Pinot Grigio
Fuckin’ your bitch she a sleazy hoe
I’m sick of hunkin that sneezy on ‘em
I’m sick of hunkin that sneezy on ‘em
I pull up on that Fanta and that Sprite
So i told that Pepsi to leave me ‘lone
All of them wish they got money on
Look at my jacket, it’s Vlone
Look at your bitch listening to Lucid Dreams
I know that shit is her theme song
I control that bitch like a remote
Run up on me then I’m down to blow
All of my niggas they grippin’ poles
Illuminati wit’ it ’cause I’ll take your soul
I go harder
Get her wetter than bottles of water
Call me stupid I’ll pull up on him
And I’ll dance like my major pulled up in a charger
Imma die for my shit like a martyr
Imma die for my shit like a martyr
Talking shit ’til i pull up on you wit’ that handy pack
See martyr niggas I’m hotter
All my niggas got shit like varietal
I see all of this shit like horizon
All my niggas get money for real tho’
In my kitchen I’m movin’ them pills hoe
Hopefully this shit hit home
Fucking that bitch like let’s go
Hit that bitch on my cell phone
I won’t fuck she on her menstrual
I murder these instrumentals
Imma hit that bitch with a backstroke
Imma hit that bitch from the back
But, shit, i’m hot you know how it is hoe
Every day I wake up lit tho
Niggas know what it is, what it is hoe
Pull up on the scene look like big cloak
It was a green lighter, that weren't no bic tho’
I smoke big gas, I smoke big blunts
Talkin’ that shit nigga waiting on nothin’
Look at your bank I just see 20s
I got hunnids’ , you got ones
Hop out abort, you is my son
Pull up on the scene, i make him run
All of my guns is horny as fuck
Pull up on the block and I'll make them cum
Yeah
I make this shit look simple
We poppin’ like proactive and a bunch of fucking pimples
I pull up in that bitch I'm past high
She my computer, my dick is that bitch’ flash drive
I get the cash, nigga you know I’m too fly
Your bitch fuckin’ my bitch
In the end she too bi
You know I don’t box
But I’m fucking like the box
You talkin’ stupid ’til you catch a shot about this Glock
Your bitch up on my cock
I told that bitch to stop
And watch
And all I do is get cash and relax, and plot
Just turn me up a notch
I wake up smoking the pot
That’s a camera
I flash just like a camera, when it pops
And if you got it, then you got it
See his gucci on his wallet
Is it Gucci or is this Louis
My designer has me confused, I don't need to stop it
I just cop it
When I drink I start from the bottom
I get long neck from your bitch, she an ostrich
Hopefully that’s not a problem
I make it look easy for real
I told you this
I told you that
I make it look easy for real
I know that it’s easy to say
But it ain’t that easy for real
I’m rolling up backwoods all day
But the papers put me in my feels
For real
Did you get all that shit?
