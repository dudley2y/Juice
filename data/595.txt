She tell me we forever
Fuck forever I just wanna fuck forever
Off a perky I could prolly fuck forever
.20 on my hip that's for whoever
He say he gon' kill me I say whatever
Niggas talk too much
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Before we shoot the place up
He wanna fight, cool
First let me smoke my blunt
Let me low my gun
Pull it out they run (Hey)

Rockstar life it was hard to make it
Bad lil bitch in the hotel naked
Told me that she know that I talk to Satan
He said he trynna kill me
Baby keep on praying
Left my percs in the room
Left the shrooms in there too
I got nothing to lose
I don't pitty the fool
If he keeps on making the rockets
He'll be making the news
Call my New York nigga to come to shoot the man too (Ooh)
You saying that you didn't do what you do
But my shooters already on you
They gon' do what they do (Ooh)
Look at your bitch
The way she fucking the crew
She thinks she part of the crew

I told her I got nothing to lose
Getting fucked up when there's nothing to do
No handouts, don't got nothing for you
Gun on my waist I got something to prove
I told her I got nothing to lose
Getting fucked up when there's nothing to do
No handouts, don't got nothing for you
Gun on my waist I got something to prove

I'm in the mood
Cupid ready to shoot
I am ready to love, but I ain't ready to lose
You got a date with destiny
Destiny ready for you
These bitches pressin' me
Do I look like a button to you?
I was together when it started
Now I'm coming to lose
Put that cupid in your face
And now I'm running from you
I went from totting to belt guns
To loving on you
I keep it on me 'cause nobody taking nothing from you (Ooh)

Every song turns to a love song
I think that my life is a love song
Fuck around, got so high it's a drug song
I love drugs, so I guess it's still a love song (Hey)
Every song turns to a love song
I think that my life is a love song
Fuck around, got so high it's a drug song
I love drugs, so I guess it's still a love song

I told her I got nothing to lose
Getting fucked up when there's nothing to do
No handouts, don't got nothing for you
Gun on my waist I got something to prove
I told her I got nothing to lose
Getting fucked up when there's nothing to do
No handouts, don't got nothing for you
Gun on my waist I got something to prove
