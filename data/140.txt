You're killing, you're killing my vibe
Uh-oh
There's something that I wanna let you know, know
Uh, uh-oh
Uh

Why you killing my vibe, blowing up my phone?
It's been over for a couple days, leave me alone
If you couldn't tell, I already moved on
To bigger and better, bigger and better
Killing my vibe, blowing up my phone
It's been over for some days, leave me alone
If you couldn't tell, I already moved on
To bigger and better, bigger and better

Life is a movie, I'm about to hit play
It's been a long ass time since I've been feeling this way
You already broke my heart, let's set that straight
Now it's your turn to get stabbed in the chest with a shank
What am I saying? I'm sorry I'm getting too graphic
Matter of fact, I don't give no fuck
I'm finna let you have it
Lovin' you was prolly one of my biggest bad habits
First it was two, I turned us into a fraction
Alright, all scars do heal in due time
Now it's time to try some new pick up lines
Uh, single for the night, yeah
Going out with the guys, yeah
Giving these bitches pipe, yeah
I'm ignorant, but yeah, I know it
Does that mean I'm still ignorant, if I know it?
I'm ignorant, but I know it
Does it make me ignorant, if I know it?

Why you killing my vibe, blowing up my phone?
It's been over for a couple days, leave me alone
If you couldn't tell, I already moved on
To bigger and better, bigger and better
Killing my vibe, blowing up my phone
It's been over for some days, leave me alone
If you couldn't tell, I already moved on
To bigger and better, bigger and better
