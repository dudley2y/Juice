I could've fought him
NLMB is the gang
NLMB is the gang
Say my name
(DJ Victoriouz with me in the building)
One fifty, bitch

I got a sniper inside of the Range
Catch a shooter while I'm driving the Range
Booted up, the Percocets not a game
Codeine chills all in the brain
I'm going in on my brain
I'm taking over your lane
I fuck your bitch and your bitch give me brain
I put my dick in your main (Let's go)

.40 on me, I bang (Grrah)
Call me Swervo but G Herbo my name (Grrah)
One-five-o, triple nine, that's the gang
Juice AP cost him two and some change
(Ooh, ayy, bitch, come hеre)
That's how I sound when she doin' thе brain
Real street niggas don't bool with no lames
If you try and kick it like Liu with the Kang
Fuck boy don't know what to do with that fame (Uh-huh)
You chasin' clout, bitches through with your name (Uh-huh)
They sayin', "Damn" and the bitch is her best friend
Ice out my pick and she cool with the brain (Uh-huh)
You get a kick out the work
Brodie told me she gon' Liu with the Kang
Used to go out with pretty Colombian girl
They taught how to rap out and move out the 'caine

I got a sniper inside of the Range
Catch a shooter while I'm driving the Range
Booted up, the Percocets not a game
Codeine chills all in the brain
I'm going in on my brain
I'm taking over your lane
I fuck your bitch and your bitch give me brain
I put my dick in your main (Yeah)
