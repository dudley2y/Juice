We get along almost every way
I write my wrongs every single day
A smile on my face cuz I get to wake up
Next to her face the feelin amazing
Wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I would die if she ever tried to run away
Got a smile on my face cuz i get to wake up
Next to her face the feelings amazing

What the future holds
We don’t know
Let's find out
The past ain't
Relevant
I’m right now
Time flies I
Remember the first day you flew out
Was witchu for a couple days
Long enough to move inside my brain
My tounge stroking your neck
I was in another country dying
Hoping I would get to see your face again
My anxiety had tears falling crying
Smiling when I saw your face again
I been thru the toxic, toxic women
So toxic that I cannot just be friends
But when I say this I mean it, no lying
I'll make sure that we don't ever end

I'll make sure that we don't ever end
I need more face forever again
Perfect, I can do better then that
Oceans, I'll get you wetter than that
Potions, I'll put the codeine down
Damn, don't need em when your around

We get along almost every way
I write my wrongs every single day

Time out Ref
Arguments
In the room
Put a cut
On my soul
I don’t wanna take it there with you
I want your love Ion really want your attitude
Sometimes it's hard for me to explain the way I feel
So it comes out as me having a attitude
I’m telling you the truth bae I'm tryna be real
And if you can't tell baby I need pills
I'm really gonna need em if you not here
Slowly but surely I’m losing my head
Sometimes it feels like I'm dead
Your the one keeping me alive
I thank God daily for putting you in my life
It feel like I got rabies cuz baby I love to bite
Down like kitty cats all damn night
We pop percs fuck asleep that's how we miss our flight
You make me wanna live the sober life
I already only fuck u when I'm sober right
Crazy to say because I'm not the sober type
Your just overnight
You improve my life
Can't exclude my wife
You be the student I'm the professor let's cool tonight

-make sure that we don't ever end
I need more face forever again
Perfect, I can do better then that
Oceans, I'll get you wetter than that
Potions, I'll put the codeine down
Damn, don't need it when your around
