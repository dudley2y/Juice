Lyrics from Snippet

...bitch, Halloween
But ain't no trick or treat, you ain't get shit from me
Put in work, lil' nigga, ain't shit for free
It ain't no trick or treat, you ain't get shit from me
Put in work, lil' nigga, ain't shit for free

All these old niggas hatin' on me
Sit in your wheelchair, huh, I think it's time to leave
"You ain't drop a hit in a minute, low-key"
And y'all think that y'all better than me
But I'm better than 'em
Probably get their bitches wetter than 'em
Bill Cosby, there's a sweater in 'em
Balenciaga on the leather denim
TMZ, I expose, huh, all them cars that you own
Tell me all thеm bitches really rentеd
You ain't gang, boy you sad, trippin', why you trippin'?
Never been a fan of ya', fuck the Uzi, got the Glock
Might not wanna stay near to her, I may come take your spot
I may come and take your thot, I may come and take it all
I may come and takeover the world
Especially if there's dough involved
So don't get involved, this a real one
Not no Super Soaker, baby, this a real gun
I smoke...
