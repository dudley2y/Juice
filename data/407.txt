Freestyle shit
Cobaine
Alright, look
Murda on the beat so it's not nice

Her name Mary Jane, but she loves cocaine
Getting so high that I can maintain
I spilt a Perc 30 with my new main thing
Bet you never had a Perc bitch give you brain
Ball so hard feel like LeBron in the Range
Transform, feel like Megatron in that thing
I'm a little high, but I'm okay
I'm a little high, but I'm okay

Ah, ah
Billy Idol with that rebel yell (Yeah)
Told that bitch that she could go to hell (Hell, yeah)
Matter fact, maybe we can meet there
I got demons, do you wanna meet them?
I got killers, you will never see them, yeah
But if you see them, it's over
.40 on me while I'm wearin' a choker
Pullin' niggas cards like poker
I guess I'm an imposer
She can call me everything but sober
Matter fact, bitch, just call me over

Her name Mary Jane, but she loves cocaine
Getting so high that I can maintain
I spilt a Perc 30 with my new main thing
Bet you never had a Perc bitch give you brain
Ball so hard feel like LeBron in the Range
Transform, feel like Megatron in that thing
I'm a little high, but I'm okay
I'm a little high, but I'm okay
