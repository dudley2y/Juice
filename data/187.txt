Gezin

Never have you waiting, baby, I'll be on time
Crazy how you the one on top of these mountains I climb
Lately, I been over anxious, you make it all right
I've never felt a love like this, first time in my life
Whenever I'm in a crisis, you stand by my side
And ride, you're so righteous
You hate it when I get high, so high I look lifeless
Yeah, it is what it is, but whatever it is, it's all the way 'til the end

You're so good at readin' my mind
Oh, how I love spending time, time, time
I, I hit the ground sometimes
But it's alright 'cause we all have a downside
All I had was a glimpse
Lost in a maze in my mind at the time
So many demons inside of me, shit don't make sense
When you wake up in hell while you laying in your bed
Wonder how the fuck did I get here or when? (Uhm)
I'm questioning everything again
Hold her tight, won't let go of her hand

Never have you waiting, baby, I'll be on time
Crazy how you the one on top of these mountains I climb
Lately, I been over anxious, you make it all right
I've never felt a love like this, first time in my life
Whenever I'm in a crisis, you stand by my side
And ride, you're so righteous
You hate it when I get high, so high I look lifeless
Yeah, it is what it is, but whatever it is, it's all the way 'til the end

Got an angel with me while I'm running through these hell pits
Me and her can share the world and end up being selfish, uh
Pretty as hell, feel her like braille, Cupid nailed it
She my umbrella when the rain storms hit
Some days high tides, some black skies
Demons leave my crib with bloody nose and black eyes
My lady choking out the Devil on my left side
She reviving me with TLC, wink with my left eye
Let's make plans, draw outlines
Take this chance of a life time
Replacements, there ain't no one
I go through the most, but you help me stay afloat

Never have you waiting, baby, I'll be on time
Crazy how you the one on top of these mountains I climb
Lately, I been over anxious, you make it all right
I've never felt a love like this, first time in my life
Whenever I'm in a crisis, you stand by my side
And ride, you're so righteous
You hate it when I get high, so high I look lifeless
Yeah, it is what it is, but whatever it is, it's all the way 'til the end
