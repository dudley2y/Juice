Girl where did you go?
I am so alone
Thinkin' 'bout the day when you woke up in my arms
Now that you're away, feel like I'm falling apart
Cross hearts take my soul
Coax me, hold me close
Eye contact, mind control, oh-oh-oh-oh

Hypnotized, I am
I don't give a damn
Antisocial, yeah
Here we go again
Listening to Blink-182 while I fuck her
Like a Roman Trojan on a rubber
Niggas think they funny, no Chris Tucker
Try'na break bread, no last supper
But back to the point, shorty got me on point
Light me up like a joint, while we smokin' a joint
And take the walk through the forest, you know the view super gorgeous
Enough about us, back to the chorus

Girl where did you go?
I am so alone
Thinkin' 'bout the day when you woke up in my arms
Now that you're away, feel like I'm falling apart
Cross hearts take my soul
Coax me, hold me close
Eye contact, mind control, oh-oh-oh-oh

You are my overdose
Too many drugs, overload
I keep on letting go, go, go, go, go
She know what makes me feel like she take my breath away
Can't breathe, breathe
Why you leave me to cry?
Why you leave me to die, die?

Girl where did you go?
I am so alone
Thinkin' 'bout the day when you woke up in my arms
Now that you're away, feel like I'm falling apart
Cross hearts take my soul
Coax me, hold me close
Eye contact, mind control, oh-oh-oh-oh
