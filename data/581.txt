Fuck everybody, I said it before, I'ma say it again, I'm just letting you know
If it ain't about money, then please hit the road
I'm not tryna sound cold, I'm just letting you know
If it ain't about paper, then you gotta go
I'ma keep it one hunnid, I'm just letting you know
If it ain't about cash, if it ain't about dough, then get the fuck on, I'm just letting you know
Fuck out my face with the talking, I hate it
Half of you niggas and bitches is basic
I don't give a fuck if you love me or hate me
If you love me, that's cool, if you hate, me then save it
I'm not to blame if my niggas go crazy
I'm letting you know, they might leave your ass faceless
I'm not to blame if we spaz out in public
I may fuck around and leave you on the pavement
Letting you know for your safety
Wish that a nigga would try me, he gon' need some savin'
Come through if you think I'm playin'
Fuck what the police is sayin'
I may come through sprayin'
Niggas is dyin' like fuckin' Iran
Pussies is fleein' like "fuck it, I ran"
Cops shootin' niggas, not givin' a damn
I swear on my life I won't give em' the chance
Guess I'm becoming a man
That's why I hate all of you niggas like I'm with the Klan
Swear that I'm dope than a gram
Run up if you think it's worth it, and pray it don't jam
Feel like the king of the land
That's what your wife'll feel like once she be holdin' my hand
Fuck all these hoes, I'm just letting you know that she might when she see all the gold on my hand
