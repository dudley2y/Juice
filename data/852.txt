On that bullshit yeah, Dennis Rodman
We pull up a hunnid deep
We pull up a hunnid deep, lookin like a army
No it ain’t no hurtin’ me, yeah I keep it on me
I play your bitch like Für Elise, now she wanna fuck me
Guess I gotta wrap it up then, like a mummy
She told me to bust a nut then, in her tummy
But I already got too many sons on my own...
...You lose my respect then you get put up for adoption
On that bullshit yeah Dennis Rodman
Dye my hair Dennis Rodman
Ball on these hoes like Rodman
Run up on a nigga what’s poppin’
Run up on a nigga what’s poppin’
I just took my main bitch shoppin’...
...on that lean on that lean speaker knockin’
Pull up in  like it’s nothin’
