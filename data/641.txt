Shit
Uh, it's been a long time comin'
But I'm still here
Everybody talking 'bout they numb or something (wait)
Can you feel hell
All this fake shit around me is this some real hell?
All this sober shit around me is there some pills hell?
For real, I need to know
I need to know
My mama tell me that I need to let 'em go
She say the syrup in these pills finna kill me
But sometimes I think it brings out the real me
Sometimes I think it brings out the concealed me
Sometimes I think it exposes and reveals me
So what happens when the real meets the real
What happens when Juice meets the pills
Uh-uh-uh, yeah
Westwood shit
I'm up in London
Gettin' it bussin'
Ain't no disscusion, run up on me then I'm drummin'
My choppa sick or something
Like it was drunk I up it it'd start to vomit (ooh)
That's a bar
Lookin' at my watch like that's a star (huh)
Lookin' at my spaceship like that's a car (huh)
Lookin' at my pills, them Xanny bars, nah
In 2016 I was poppin' them Xannies
Now I'm in Percies
Lastin' forever in 
Run up on me goin' harder than granny
Sit down muhfucker 'cause I know you can't stand it
Outlandish, I'm gorilla in the mesh
You just a Kung Fu Panda
I ain't sippin' clean nothin', this some dirty Fanta
With a bitch on my lap like my first name Santa
You get jacked like a pumpkin, no O'Lantern, uh
VVS on my ring like the Green Lantern you gon' kiss it like a Mafia king
I'm a boss, that's a Mafia thing
808 my chopper that's a Mafia thing, yeah, uh
Yeah, I did it
Mom, I made it
From goin' to physics class, to
Tourin' the world, shittin' on everybody, the world is my potty
I'm shitting on every possy
And I don't even got a team like that
I aim with my eye, I don't need a beam like that
Run up on me, choppa make you sing like that
Make you march like Martin Luther King, in fact
I'm blacked, and excellent
I'm shittin' on these niggas, this is a excrement
I rapped on another beat that's some extra shit
You niggas gon' have to deal with the mess of it
I thought I told yo' ass not to mess wit' it
I see this shit before I say it, telepathy
It's like I talk to my conscious, I say what it's tellin' me
Anything besides money, eh, it's kinda irrelevant
I can't focus without codeine, my medicine
I sip it until I'm slurrin' and spittin' impediments
I'm ballin' to the point where I think I need a Letterman
Westwood at the gates of London, he just had to let 'em in
I'm here, spazzin' on every single track he pass
You run up, I leave you leakin' on a maxipad
I'm ballin', hard, these other niggas on the bench
I swear, they need to stay where they at
Nigga, I'm takin' over the world, a map for a map
I'm off of a ecstasy pill, that's a flat for a flat
I'm up to bat, throw a fastball, it's a hit
I hit a lick, then I hit a hit on yo' bitch I don't miss
Listen, I heard yo' bitch on my hitlist
I hit that bitch, then I'm dippin'
You run up on me, I'm shootin'
That choppa on me is spittin'
My wordplay is amazing
My flow is so brazy (huh)
I'm shakin' shit up like I said, no Haiti
This is freestyle shit, it's authentic
My flow, it burns niggas
Careers is arsenic (uh)
My flow badder than bad women
I rock shows like Kravitz and John Lennon
Yo' sins ain't forgivin'
I'm the rap god, call me Juice Allah
Did I take it too far?
Did I take two bars, to get on Mars?
To more like  (hold on)
I got a little tongue twisted, but I'm still gifted
Still spittin', still rippin' writtens
This premonition is really killin' it
And these niggas ain't shit
But Civics, me I'm Bentley
Get it, bitch
Don't you forget it
The shit that you talking, I really lived it (uh)
I sold my soul then bought it back, I finessed 'em (uh)
You run up on me, choppa holy it'll bless 'em (uh)
He talking stupid 'till they shoot him, that's my weapon (uh)
I got a couple of bars I could spit
Maybe I'll just use 'em in this shit
Or maybe I'll just use 'em in a skit
My first guess, they wanted shit
My next project, it's gon' be harder
My arm in the rim, really, I feel like Vince Carter
I'm at yo' head nigga, I feel like a barber
You on the bench nigga, and I am a starter
I die for my shit nigga, feel like I'm a martyr
My shit's off the charts
You run up, that's okay you catch a hole to your heart
I put that on my life, and that shit come from the heart
I'm freestyling on live, that's how it is
Yo' bitch swallow the kids
She up in my crib, I'm tellin' you how it is
Man, this rap shit serious like XM (huh)
I ex them (huh)
I fuck the bitch that he's next to (uh)
She hangin' out, fuck her curfew (uh)
You my son, lil' nigga I birthed you
But I shine, like the pair of them church shoes
I ain't been to church in a long time, 'cause they all lies
All the legends, where they at? They all die
Well, I don't wanna be a legend up in my prime
But, I know it's still prime time
Stars, how I shine
When they align with the planet, you know some shit is goin' on
I transform like Omegatron, when my favourite song is on
Fuckin' that bitch like the Ramadan
Man, I spit shit
So cool
I breakdance shit like the old school
I'm never runnin' out of energy, I'm a suspect grippin' this  vicinity
Try me if you want, 'cause I swear it's not gon' end cool
I'ma prolly pull up to your cruel like, "Where the fuck is you"
Cock it back and then I shoot
W-W-W, I can't lose
Ayy, I flew from London to Chicago
Money in my pockets, I may get a Murci√©lago
That's all that I know
Shout out to my kinfolk, they know I'm totin' ammo
In the streets they call me Rambo, ain't no peace where I'm from
But these pieces, we tote 'em, you run up on me it's over
Like a cig, we gon' smoke 'em
I put yo' ass in a coma
Smokin' kush, this aroma, leave yo' ass in a coma
Ballin' out like I'm Odom before the crack, don't you get it?
Spittin' crack on these niggas, define niggas like physics
Shut the fuck up and listen, I'm ballin' hard like a Piston
Nigga this shit's enlisted just like a army lil' nigga
I swear to god I'm invincible you can't harm me lil' nigga, yeah
I'm talkin' to you
I sent you my address a couple weeks ago, you ain't come through
'Cause you know we was gon' leave yo' ass dropped like a sunroof on a new coupe
Haha, I talk a lotta shit
But it all means something
