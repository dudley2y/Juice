Lyrics From Snippet

...hand on my 45 bitch
I've been popping xans, I've been feeling life bitch
Looking at my main, that's my side bitch
Ride it like a motorbike,  like a sidekick
Chopper on me, got a sidekick
I just made love with my side bitch
 my bitch and she like it
She gon' ride me like bike
Hey, don't wanna fuck your bitch 
Aye, aye aye aye
Woke up in the morning, I got some more money today
L-M-A-O, you niggas looking funny today
You keep it ten while I keep it a hunnid today
Got a hunnid round drum hangin' out the hummer today
I just wanna get paid
I just wanna get laid
They just wanna play games
We can play but I don't come in first place
Chopper ...
