Enviyon on the mix
I just wanna live my life

Okay, okay, alright
I've been getting high all night
Went to L.A. and I took the wrong flight
Got high then I took the wrong ride
Balling but I feel like off sides
Smoking weed just to pass time
Can't live in the past time
Looking at the future, all mine, oh

I remember when I fell in love, fell in love
And it blew up in my face, land mine
I remember doing hella Xans, hella Percocets
Thinking that was finna pass time
I feel like I'm Tony Hawk, kick push, kick push
Yeah, I'm on my grind
They wanna see me on TV, yeah
Cause I be ballin' like it's prime time
And my ex calls my phone
Every now and then she won't get a response
'Cause it's money on my phone (Cash on my phone)
Ballin' hard in the Saint Laurent

Leave me alone
You know I'm gone, yeah you know I'm gone
Why you still on my phone
You know what I'm on, I'm on a money hunt, yeah

I just gotta keep this shit together
I just gotta keep this shit together
I just need the, I just need the money that's forever
You know what I'm on I'm on a money hunt, yeah
I just gotta keep this shit together
I just gotta keep this shit together
I just want the money that's forever
That's forever, that's forever, that's forever
You know what I'm on, I'm on a money hunt

Okay, okay, alright
I've been getting high all night
Went to L.A. and I took the wrong flight
