Earl on the beatLousy

Can't you see the diamonds in the face?
Wanna fight? Cool, we could run a fade
I been ballin' on these hoes like D. Wade
After I fuck her, she gon' throw away
Yeah, I'm here to put these niggas in they place
Down to earth, but off the drugs, I'm outer space
Secure the bag, do it again and relocate
Chopper blast if you standin' in my way
