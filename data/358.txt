Heaven

Got to go through hell to get to heaven
Got to learn through life to get the lesson
Feelin' like a lil' kid, A adolescent
Feelin' like the answers out of my reach
Praying out to God, please help me, please help me
Oh-oh-oh (Help me, help me, dear Lord, please help me)
Oh-oh-oh (Help me, help me, dear Lord, please help me)
Oh-oh-oh (Lord, help me, help me, dear Lord, please help me)
(Help me, oh)
Stuck in the same place, yeah, no space like a crawl space, yeah
No love, all hatred, can't live in a place like that
Ooh, I admit, never felt no pain like this
Prolly 'cause all the pills I did, pills I did, oh
Tryna fight the demons, think I'm movin' forward but I'm in the same place, yeah-yeah
Fast forward, in a black Porsche, tryna figure out and maintain, yeah-yeah
Heart don't feel the same no more
Had enough love games, lil' ho
Don't think I can love the same anymore

Time to move on, time to move on
Time to move on, time to move on
Time to move on, time to move on
Time to move on, time to move on, uh

Happiness ain't bankrolls, you the type to have me keep my heart closed
Tellin' me you wanna work out the same things that ain't work in the first place
Hard for me to keep my eyes open, had me ballin' out, my eyes swollen
I've had enough, this isn't love, not even lust
I know what it really is, it's done
Honestly ain't wanna be the one
To say it's over but this shit is overdue
I know what it really is, it's done
I ain't wanna be the one to say it's over, but bitch, it's over
It's over, bitch, it's over
It's o-over, bitch, it's over
Ain't no lullabies, just nightmares, just nightmares
Ain't no lullabies, just nightmares with you there
Ain't no lullabies and if there's lullabies, they're full of lies that you care
It's over

It's over, bitch, it's over
It's o-over, bitch, it's over
Bitch, it's over, hey
