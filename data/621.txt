Lyrics from snippet
Gun in the bag, gun in the bag, yeah, uh
Keep me a gun in the bag, right next to my mask, yeah, uh
NASA I'ma take off, ballin' on these niggas like the playoffs
Killer at heart like Adolf
Russian creams with the codeine and the faygo, yeah
Uh, huh
Ay, rest in piss, freestyle my flows
Freestyle my hoes
Ball like Derrick Rose on these hoes, lets go, uh
Run up on me I blow, uh
My charm like fe-fi-fo, uh
Mister take you're ho, uh
Cocaine make it snow, uh
Sell that on the low, uh
Don't let nobody know, uh
My flow go so fuckin' cold, I may just be a Eskimo
Yo ho is my side ho, on another day she my extra ho
Why these bitches tweakin' in my DMs actin' extra for?
Takin' 'bout, "They my wifey", I don't even know you
Triflin' ho, uh
