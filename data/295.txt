I'ma drown-own-own
Oh-ho
Yeah

I'ma drown, in the pain
I'ma drown, in the rain
I'ma drown in the liquor again
I'ma drown in a pool full of sins
I'ma drown, in the pain
I'ma drown, in the rain
I'ma drown in the liquor again
I'ma drown in a pool of my sins

Ho-oh
Here we go again
Here you go again
Will the drama ever end?
I've been drinking on a binge
I've been living on the edge
I've been stumblin', strugglin' off the Hennessy again
I get drunk and call my ex, on the phone
I never send a text, I'm alone
I'm failin' all her tests, no honor roll
I'm jumpin' to my doom, Geronimo

To hell I fall, it's a long way down
I need your love right now
I need the drugs right now
I need the plug (Right now)

I'ma drown, in the pain
I'ma drown, in the rain
I'ma drown in the liquor again
I'ma drown in a pool full of sins
I'ma drown, in the pain
I'ma drown, in the rain
I'ma drown in the liquor again
I'ma drown in a pool of my sins

Woke up in a coffin, am I dead or alive?
I'm just trynna live my life
Tatted on my wrist three nines
The devil tryna take his time
I'm in hell baby, you drive me crazy
Crash my Mercedes
I will not make it, right
I just ran the light
I walk to the light (Oh)

To hell I fall, it's a long way down
I need your love right now
I need the drugs Right now
I need the plug (Right now)

I'ma drown, in the pain
I'ma drown, in the rain
I'ma drown in the liquor again
I'ma drown in a pool full of sins
I'ma drown, in the pain
I'ma drown, in the rain
I'ma drown in the liquor again
I'ma drown in a pool of my sins
