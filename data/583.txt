Ay, OZ, you a big dog now, you get to bark

I got what you need baby
I can take the pain away for one night
I know you got needs baby
But all you really need is a good high
Bad drugs from a good guy
Codeine sipping suicide
So I got what you need baby
You can die to me baby

Mixing up the drugs
That go with this one, codeine my piss, uh
Mix it with the Adderall, help me wake up
Got me running on the walls, throwing paper
Drugs got me finna fall, can't stand up
I done been through it all, life's dangerous
Lately I ain't a Cali guy, damn
From a blunt to the face, smoke it then I replace it
Popping pills in Cali, God damn
Get the percs from the doc 'cause he think my back aching
Feels amazing, can't think straight
Drugs got me spacing
Brains on the pavement

I got what you need baby
I can take the pain away for one night
I know you got needs baby
But all you really need is a good high
Bad drugs from a good guy
Codeine sipping suicide
So I got what you need baby
You can die to me baby


I got what you need baby
