Woke up, dropped a pill in my OJ
Am I coming back down? No way
Keep that chopper on my side, Scarface
'Cause I don't trust no one, sorry
I don't need handouts, no thanks
'Cause I'ma get rich my own way
I'ma dunk off my own play
I'ma take off, no track race

Money make me healthy, countin' up the celery
Broke niggas can't talk, what the fuck you tellin' me?
Smoke until my eyes red, she can see the Hell in me
Catch me with a bad ho, better than a felony
But these hoes be phony, tried to fuck on your homie
She'll tell you she lonely, while she layin' next your bros, ayy
I don't got time for her, no, no
I'm too rich to have my heart broke
Spendin' all my money on the finer things
Went to sleep, I woke up then I took a bean

Woke up, dropped a pill in my OJ
Am I coming back down? No way
Keep that chopper on my side, Scarface
'Cause I don't trust no one, sorry
I don't need handouts, no thanks
'Cause I'ma get rich my own way
I'ma dunk off my own play
I'ma take off, no track race

Two girls times two for the foreplay
You know I was finna fuck and duck 'em anyway
After that I drop a four inside my Minute Maid
Might just mix it with the perky, never been afraid
Off a party pack, but I don't ever party, ho
In my hotel room on the molly, ho
I can see the universe with my eyes closed
Blink twice, everything goin' slow-mo
Face, roll it up, face
Fuckin' on a bitch that smoke percs, free base
Keep it on the low light, I'm a free maze
Bitch, I'm on go like runnin' lights

Woke up, dropped a pill in my OJ
Am I coming back down? No way
Keep that chopper on my side, Scarface
'Cause I don't trust no one, sorry
I don't need handouts, no thanks
'Cause I'ma get rich my own way
I'ma dunk off my own play
I'ma take off, no track race
