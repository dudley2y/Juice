The song

I feel the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
It seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treated me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I was gettin' tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, shit, I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you

Uh, digest, digest
This lil' heart of mine, I won't let you smash it
Burn me up inside, turn me into ashes (Uh)
Why, why?
This lil' soul of mine, won't let it get intertwined
Uh, with somebody, I always fail to realize that
They were never mine, they were never ever mine
I was just a part in her painstaking process
This lil' soul of mine, won't let you get control of mine (Uh)
Won't let you control my mind, yeah, I gotta keep that mindset
This lil' soul of mine, won't let you control mine
Oh, now you wanna stay and work it out? Not this time

I feel the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
It seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treated me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I was gettin' tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, shit, I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you


I feel the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
It seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treated me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I was gettin' tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, shit, I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you
