808 Mafia

This little mind of mine has a tendency to get a little dark and violent, ayy
This little life of mine is a nightmare (Ha)
I feel
Medicated, elevated, too sedated
Thank God that a nigga made it
Fucked three broads, they was all faded
Oh my God, now I feel famous
New gun, can't wait to aim it
Mama on the phone, saying, "Chill baby"
I'm way too rich to go and risk it all
But fuck it, I'm finna risk it (Uh, huh)
Catch me .30 clippin' (Uh, huh)
Shoot like Scottie Pippen (Uh, huh)
Like, "Get the fuck away from my ride"
You ain't finna rob a nigga (Uh, huh)
I hang with robbers, they on go
I got an army with me like damn, don't they look like G.I. Joe
Marching your shit like Fee-fi-fo
Run up on me, to your head, I'll blow
I'll run to the bag like ready-set-go
I don't trust you, they'll shoot, I'm Metro
Back-back in the days, I was out robbing for Jay's
Look at the way I glow
Stuck in my ways, keep me a Glock in the safe
You know I'm on go

Ha, yeah, ain't that the truth
Uh, tried to run up, ain't he a fool
Ayy, up that choppa, vamanos
Ayy, I feel like a dentist (Huh), put a bullet in his tooth, uh
Knocked that out of the park, uh, pussy like Babe Ruth, uh
I'm finna hang me a nigga, uh, somebody grab me a noose, uh
Feel my wrath as I stomp 'em in my Rafs
Shoot up your crib, see you dead, then I laugh
Walk to the bank, then I laugh again
Fire on me, no dragon, ayy
Off of the Percs, I'm dragging
Count up the money and stacking, ayy
.40 on me no lacking
Run up, I get shit bracking, ayy
Thot on my line, she wanna fuck for the low (Huh, uh)
I don't pay for pussy, but yeah, I'll fuck you on the low (Huh, uh)
In other words, I won't let nobody know
But I'm Kobe with that torch, pass me, I'ma score
Yeah, smash her, then I go (What?)
Then I set another play
Pass her, pick and roll (What?)
Brodie fucked the same day
Put that on my soul, oh, you know lies ho
Hope you realize, you're fucking with some real guys
