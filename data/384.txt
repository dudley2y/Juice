Wrong side of the bed, felt like I wanted to die
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah

I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, felt like I wanted to die
And yeah, I still remember what you said, every word was a lie
But I can't survive, without you by my side
I can't survive, without you by my side

Lovin' you became an instinct, nah, I don't gotta try (Yeah)
I promise you, if you don't love me back, it's a suicide, ah (Yeah)
Tie the rope all around my neck and poison my heart
Now I lay in my grave, wishin' you would have saved me

I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, felt like I wanted to die
And yeah, I still remember what you said, every word was a lie
But I can't survive, without you by my side
I can't survive, without you by my side


I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, felt like I wanted to die
And yeah, I still remember what you said, every word was a lie
But I can't survive, without you by my side
I can't survive, without you by my side
