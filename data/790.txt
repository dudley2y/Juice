(I’d do anything
To uh, uh uh
See you smile
Do anything
In my power
To see)

I’d do anything, in my power
To see you just smile
I want you to prosper
And come proper
Even if that means I ain’t by your side
I’d do anything in my power
To see you just smile
I want you to prosper
And come proper
Even if that means I ain’t by your side

Devil on my shoulder tellin' me I'll die soon
I don't really want that to impact you
But I don't know, maybe I'm just paranoid
I just want the best for you, I just want what's left of you
Oh, you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah, I pray that I get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright
Oh, you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah, I pray that I get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright

I’d do anything, in my power
To see you just smile
I want you to prosper
And come proper
Even if that means I ain’t by your side
I’d do anything in my power
To see you just smile
I want you to prosper
And come proper
Even if that means I ain’t by your side

Between you and me I think that I’m gon’ die
Soon, it’s cool
I got what’s coming to me it’s cool
Ain’t no point runnin’ from me, it’s cool
Ain’t no escaping, I tried to escape it
But I hate it
Am I complex, am I basic
Interviews with complex, very basic
Shit I hate it
The worst thing I ever did was become famous
The doctor told me I’d be dead by next June
Unless I stop all these pills I’m in to
I haven’t had enough
I want to die below

I’d do anything, in my power
To see you just smile
I want you to prosper
And come proper
Even if that means I ain’t by your side
I’d do anything in my power
To see you just smile
I want you to prosper
And come proper
Even if that means I ain’t by your side
