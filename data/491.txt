Sound like All-American Rejects, haha (Hit-Boy)
That's a rock star, rock star
Uh

Drift with me like the '70s
She groovy like the '70s
Just like my Percs, she's next to me (Yeah)
The feeling's so heavenly
But we in hell, hell, hell, hell
Still tryna do well, well, well, well
We in hell, hell, hell
Don't wish us well, we'll do well

I've been through so much with her
I fucked up, but I still matured
My old hoes do not fuck wit' her
That's cool, if you tryna fuck she'll fuck me with you
I found an angel, in hell
She's from heaven, she's from heaven
I found an angel, in hell
But she's from heaven, she's from heaven

Drift with me like the '70s
She groovy like the '70s
Just like my Percs, she's next to me (Yeah)
The feeling, so heavenly
But we in hell, hell, hell, hell
Still tryna do well, well, well, well
We in hell, hell, hell
Don't wish us well, we'll do well
