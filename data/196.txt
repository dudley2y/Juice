Na, na-na-na, na, na
Na, na-na-na
This song is literally my canvas, I can say whatever the fuck (Yeah)
M-M-Murda

Drownin' in the Hennessy, it feel like I’m dreamin'
They say liquor bad for me, they say I don’t need it
But I’ma drink the the whole fifth this evenin’
I'ma drink the whole fifth this evenin'
Sometimes I like codeine, sometimes I like leanin'
Sometimes I like perkies, sometimes I like beamin'
But I’ma drink the whole fifth this evenin'
I’ma drink this whole fifth this evenin'

I'ma drink the whole damn fifth
Then I'ma fuck a bad ass bitch
Then I'ma take a few Xanax
So in the mornin' I might forget
Now there’s some random bitch in my bed
But she says that she had a good time
Same girl keeps running through my head
I won’t let you get away this time
I gotta broke heart can you fix, mine
I gotta full cup come and sip, mine
I gotta new script come and flip, mine
I won’t let you get away this, time (Yeah)

Drownin' in the Hennessy, it feel like I’m dreamin'
They say liquor bad for me, they say I don’t need it
But I’ma drink the the whole fifth this evenin'
I'ma drink the whole fifth this evenin'
Sometimes I like codeine, sometimes I like leanin'
Sometimes I like perkies, sometimes I like beamin'
But I’ma drink the whole fifth this evenin'
I’ma drink this whole fifth this evenin'


Drownin' in the Hennessy, it feel like I’m dreamin'
They say liquor bad for me, they say I don’t need it
But I’ma drink the the whole fifth this evenin'
I'ma drink the whole fifth this evenin'
Sometimes I like codeine, sometimes I like leanin'
Sometimes I like perkies, sometimes I like beamin'
But I’ma drink the whole fifth this evenin'
I’ma drink this whole fifth this evenin'
