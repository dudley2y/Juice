Mega, you played that boy

Ayy‚ smoke so much I think I need another lung
Ayy‚ fuck my liver up‚ I need another one
Fell in love with Perkys, yeah, I love the blues
Mix it with the Henny‚ ain't got shit to lose
Now I'm seein' double, seein' two, seein' two
I feel like a ghost when I look at you‚ peek-a-boo
I get so damn high, I don't know what to do, up to you
You could be my lover and my drug too

I could show you what the drugs do
I could show you what the plug do
I'ma hit his phone right now
Perc 30's, need 'em, come through
God damn, scratched myself to death
Choppa, Breaking Bad, just like crystal meth, nigga
I'm on yo' ass, leakin' like Maxi-Pad
I go harder than a nigga try'na catch a taxi cab
Call of Duty with that toolie (Huh), no lag
Gotta keep it on me, my lil' paranoid ass
It's prolly 'cause I'm too high all the damn time
It feel like everybody comin' after my life

Smoke so much I think I need another lung
Ayy, fuck my liver up, I need another one
Fell in love with Perkys, yeah, I love the blues
Mix it with the Henny, ain't got shit to lose
Now I'm seein' double, seein' two, seein' two
I feel like a ghost when I look at you, peek-a-boo
I get so damn high, I don't know what to do, up to you
You could be my lover and my drug too

'Member I done did it by my lonely
'Member when I had a one and only
Then she hurt me, talking to the Perkys
She could call my phone but it ain't workin'
I'm on top, I get top
In the drop, fuck that shit, I swerve a lot
Swerve a lot, on that bitch, I swerve a lot, yeah
I'ma talk the talk, it's the talk of a boss
I don't talk it, I walk it
Run up on me, I'm poppin'
Keep the gun in my pocket, yeah
Double G on me, that's when I'm shoppin', yeah
Run up a sack, don't run out of options

Smoke so much I think I need another lung
Ayy, fuck my liver up, I need another one
Fell in love with Perkys, yeah, I love the blues
Mix it with the Henny, ain't got shit to lose
Now I'm seein' double, seein' two, seein' two
I feel like a ghost when I look at you, peek-a-boo
I get so damn high, I don't know what to do, up to you
You could be my lover and my drug too
