Boy

Walkin' in the Follies with some diamonds on my body
Fashionably late, yeah, tardy to the party
Ray Charles to the bullshit, I can't see nobody
All my money on that blue shit, I could buy a cruise ship
.40 in a stash-box, try it if you want, yeah
I'm in the back of her car gettin' slop top
Missed her face, so I nutted on her crop top, yeah, gentleman

Say certain things, just to get a reaction
Hit her with that Drake shit, those other guys are practice
Yeah, they were distractions to you, now let's get it crackin'
I say crackin' with a K because I love my slimes
Back to the subject at hand, money on my mind
Thinkin' 'bout the cash again
Lookin' back, thinkin' 'bout the past again
Where we at now, it's a whole different place
Used to be sad, now I got blue faces
Took the red and the blue pill, that's a new Matrix
Let's celebrate, hip-hip, uh-huh, hooray

Walkin' in the Follies with some diamonds on my body
Fashionably late, yeah, tardy to the party
Ray Charles to the bullshit, I can't see nobody
All my money on that blue shit, I could buy a cruise ship
.40 in a stash-box, try it if you want, yeah
I'm in the back of her car gettin' slop top
Missed her face, so I nutted on her crop top, yeah, gentleman
