Lyrics From Snippets

Wheezy outta here

Huh, bitch, we got it (Uh-huh), bitch, we ridin' (Uh-huh)
If it's smoke, then it's smoke, bitch, we slidin' (Uh-huh)
Put this .40 down your throat, that's my sidekick (Ya dig?)
That's my side bitch (Ya dig?), that's my side bitch (Uh, yeah)
Tell 'em how we livin', lavish (Yeah)
Tell 'em who I live with, savages (Rah, rah, rah, rah)
Tell 'em what they keep on them, ratchets (Grah)
We ain't playing tennis, but it's racket

Bad TV with the opps, yeah, static
New VV's on the watch it's extravagant
Bad TV with the opps, yeah, static
New VV's on the watch it's extravagant
Hopped in (Uh-huh), bad bitch
Took her shoppin', not in America
Went to London, off the Percs get it bussin'
Me and Pluto get it bussin' (Bussin')
In that Tesla off a Tesla, bitch I'm bussin' (Bussin')

Huh, bitch, we got it (Uh-huh), bitch, we ridin' (Uh-huh)
If it's smoke, then it's smoke, bitch, we slidin' (Uh-huh)
Put this .40 down your throat, that's my sidekick (Ya dig?)
That's my side bitch (Ya dig?), that's my side bitch (Uh, yeah)
Tell 'em how we livin', lavish (Yeah)
Tell 'em who I live with, savages (Rah, rah, rah, rah)
We ain't playing tennis, but it's racket
