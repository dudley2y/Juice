Yeah
Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, I'm a bad boy
Ayy

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, I'm a bad boy
Went and got off my ass and got to the cash
And got in my bag, boy
Please don't think it's sweet, I stay with the heat
Even though I'm a sad boy
You better watch the way you breathe around me
'Fore that breath be your last, boy (It's on)
I've been drinking red ras', boy (Red, yeah)
I've been trappin' all these birds, McCoy (McCoy)
Newborn baby, my Richard Mille in nine months (Ooh)
Overseas, hundred scheme, bitch, croissants (Uh)

Yeah, ha, get up
Ballin' on your nigga, no pick up (Yeah)
Don't got a gun, better get one (Yeah)
So many weapons, I pick one (Yeah)
My chopper at Elliott
Arrival took thirty minutes
Just to go put the clip on (Yeah)
I DM your bitch, I ask her for her face
I need somethin' to put my dick on
These niggas be leechin'
Lookin' for a wave to steal, a wave to get on
Them be the same niggas that I told myself I was finna go get rich and go shit on
I've always been a bully
Rather pick on a motherfucker than get picked on
Everybody wanna talk tough
When the Draco out lips ziplock
