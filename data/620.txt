My lil' bitch love Fendi's, huh
And I don't mean that fake shit
My gun full as hell, boy, please don't make me empty it
You could catch a shell, boy, fuck nigga don't tempt me
I let it go, I let it go
Just let it go, I let it go
Fuck nigga don't tempt me, I let it go
I let it go, I let it go
Fuck nigga don't tempt me
She ride like a ten-speed
Bad bitch from Miami
Dive in the pussy like 10 feet
I was in the cut with a semi
Can't let a fuck nigga get me
Can't let a fuck nigga catch me, yeah
She can still suck me up, yeah
Came in the club with a supersonic, nigga no G.I. Joe
Feel like a giant around these lil' ass niggas, nigga no fee-fi-fo
She want to fuck, she want the Henny and vodka, bitch I drunk it all
Just sit back, let me break your back, just like I break the law

Pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew

Blow some hundreds to the bitch inside the bank
Woke up rich, nigga talkin' but he can't
Foe nem hit you with that choppa like a snake
I told you that I don't got time for the snakes
Run up, you get hit, that choppa break your bank
And that bitch gon' fuckin' fuck on the first date
I'm gon prolly fucking cum all on her face
Woke up hard, do that shit like every day
Shoot my choppa, at every bitch that made me wait
I got a Glock, I won't use a razorblade
Gold in my mouth, my , bitch no Flava Flav
Get so rich  for my age
Should've died before you sent a fucking text, yeah
 put my dick inside my next
Fuck her once, then I gotta make an exit
I'm in the past tense
Run up, I'm blastin'
 lackin'
Nigga you fake as fuck, you be cappin'
Like a poetry slam, I be snappin'
Nigga talkin' shit but what happens to them
Pull up on him, that gun...
