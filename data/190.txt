Hahahaha, Nick you're stupid
Mm, yee-haw (Huh, yeah)

All alone (All alone)
Fighting (Fighting)
On my own (On my own)
Fighting (Fighting)
All alone (All alone)
Fighting-ing (Fighting)
On my own (On my own)
Fighting (Fighting)

Jump out my sleep, demons haunting
Me in my memories (My memories)
Did this happen? (Did this happen?)
Or was that a dream?
I, I, I can't seem to grip reality

Oh, was it a dream?
Oh, was it a dream? (Huh)

All alone (All alone)
Fighting (Fighting)
On my own (On my own)
Fighting (Fighting)
All alone (All alone)
Fighting-ing (Fighting)
On my own (On my own)
Fighting (Fighting)

Don't know where to go
I am in the cold
It's a lonely road
The ones who know, know
Yeah, the devil throwin' low blows
Back to the wall bitch, oh no
They ask me how I'm feelin', I say, “So-so"
Even when I feel low, low

Oh, was it a dream?
Oh, was it a dream? (Huh, yeah)

All alone (All alone)
Fighting (Fighting)
On my own (On my own)
Fighting (Fighting)
All alone (All alone)
Fighting-ing (Fighting)
On my own (On my own)
Fighting (Fighting)
