Bitch, I'm in Greece like Zeus
Uh-huh (Ayy, KBeaZy, you fye'd up), yeah

Raf Simons on my shoe, ooh
Margiela on my shoe, uh
Murakami on my shoe
One-of-one, these are not for you
Too high, can't talk to you (Let's go, let's go)
To all my ex's that wanna be friends
Boo-thing lame, 'cause I'm not them
You see me walkin' around in your rent
In this Burberry poncho, it look like a tent
Audemar on my wrist, I'ma ball on a bitch
Spend it all on my bitch ass (Cake)
Nah, I'm lyin', I ain't spend it all 'cause I'm rich
I be handlin' my business (Hooray)

In the studio all night long
Want the ooh-nah-nah when I get home
Oh, yeah, hold me close, you got that good
You would make me feel rich even if I was broke (That's all on the hood)
And you understand me I ain't have to show you the ropes (I'm so misunderstood)

Ayy, I love daily trips to the bank
I sit in the passenger seat while you drive, you hate when I drive and I drink
Cut one of my day one niggas off, so I wanna listen to Drake
Talkin' 'bout that Thank Me Later, how the fame'll make 'em change
I'm done doin' niggas favors
I'm just focused on collectin' paper and lovin' my baby and startin a label
Gotta watch who you let grab a seat and a plate
They can't eat, ain't no fakes at the table
Gotta cut 'em off, give 'em the razor
It's a shock when they switch on you, taser
I wear that pain like a mask, Darth Vader

In the studio all night long
Want the ooh-nah-nah when I get home
Oh, yeah, hold me close, you got that good
You would make me feel rich even if I was broke (That's all on the hood)
And you understand me I ain't have to show you the ropes (I'm so misunderstood)
