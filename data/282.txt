(G. Ry got me)

Spend it all, make it all back, make it all
Find out where her hotel at so she can take it off
Watch her as she takes it off
Louis Vuitton don bras, the PrimaDonna drawers
It's gettin' hot in here, won't you take off your clothes?
I feel like bustin' loose, but I'm not Nelly, ho, yeah
Throw a party on that ass, throw confetti on it
By confetti, I mean different color money
I keep more than hunnids comin'

Oh yeah, I got pounds, I got bills, I got chronos
I got pesos, I got euros, I got chronos
I got green, I got blue, she got red nose
She got red from doin' all the white, ohh (Let’s go)

Percocet and the car in steer (Oh)
My vision blurry, hell (Uh-huh)
But no way, I'm not scared (Oh)
You know I do not care (Oh)
Cops, they on my trail (Uh-huh)
Put the coke in your derrière
And you better not tattletale (Uh-huh)
In the midnight air, we lit (Uh)
We a bunch of troubled kids (Uh-huh)
Screamin' "Fuck the scholarships" (Uh-huh)
We won't acknowledge it (Uh-uh)
We need acknowledgment (Uh-huh)
Motherfucker better pay they respects (Uh-huh)
I'm playin' on a cello, smokin' cigarillos and Rambo totin' my TEC (Uh-huh)
I done made it out the ghetto, stay out the ghetto forever (Yeah), I'm done with that (Uh-huh)
If I go broke, I'ma rob these Hollywood folks (Yeah), I ain't comin' back (Uh-uh)
Baby, where you at? (Uh-huh)
Let me get back on track (Let's go)
Send yo' 'telly address (Uh-huh)
And I'ma come break yo' back (Let's go)

Spend it all, make it all back, make it all
Find out where her hotel at so she can take it off
Watch her as she takes it off (Takes it off)
Louis Vuitton don bras, the PrimaDonna drawers (Yeah)
It's gettin' hot in here (It is), won't you take off your clothes? (Come on)
I feel like bustin' loose (I do), but I'm not Nelly, ho (Uh-uh), yeah
Throw a party on that ass, throw confetti on it (Throw confetti)
By confetti, I mean different color money
I keep more than hunnids comin'

Oh yeah, I got pounds, I got bills, I got chronos
I got pesos, I got euros, I got chronos
I got green, I got blue, she got red nose
She got red from doin' all the white, ohh
