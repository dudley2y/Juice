They love it when I talk shit
I'm a real drunk so I'ma be talkin' like shit

They love it when I talk shit
I can hit em' with the rap or the rock shit
Catch me on my skateboard with my Glock, stick
I can catch a fuck nigga and a kickflip (Hey, pew, pew, pew)
I feel like a rebel on my BAPE shit
Niggas sad that they feelings on they hate shit
I'm just sad that my feelings on my hurt shit
But fuck the pain I'ma kill it with the perc shit (Hey, ayy)

Boy, I know your pockets hurtin'
Off the drugs I'ma whole different person
I called my ex on the phone, is it worth it? (hey)
I'll be rich and she'll be hurting
So it's worth it, it's worth it
I remember my momma thought I was a burden
Mom I'm sorry for the troubles here's a Birkin
All of the stress I put you through, yeah, you deserve it
I remember when you was in the hospital
You was the only one I knew that was hurtin'
Now I'm up in LA, doing drugs, drunk driving, I'm swerving
Put my seat belt on, every now and then
'Cause I know you be nervous
Get me a Goyard bag and I'ma buy you a matching Birkin
I promised you when I get money
I'm turning into a whole different person

They love it when I talk shit
I can hit em' with the rap or the rock shit
Catch me on my skateboard with my Glock, stick
I can catch a fuck nigga and a kickflip (Hey, pew, pew, pew)
I feel like a rebel on my BAPE shit
Niggas sad that they feelings on they hate shit
I'm just sad that my feelings on my hurt shit
But fuck the pain I'ma kill it with the perc shit (Hey, ayy)

They never hurt me like this before
Every day I love a different whore
Every day I leave a different ho
Don't wonder why I'm so alone
Got the Louis, Xanny dose
Hopefully that I don't overdoese
I never fuck with a main girl
'Cause these bitches do the most
She never seen me this high before
I'm off a perc I need several more
Rockstar, rock dose
Jump in the pussy, feel like I'm Geronimo
She be loving all my tattoos
I don't talk shit, my racks do
Only for me, that's cool
I throw you to my Chiraq goons
It could be simple, It could all be so simple
Pay me what you owe or catch my extendo
If she don't get a minimum, she get talks like denmo
I'm in hell tryna dance with the devil

They love it when I talk shit
I can hit 'em with the rap or the rock shit
Catch me on my skateboard with my Glock, stick
I can catch a fuck nigga and a kickflip (Hey, pew, pew, pew)
I feel like a rebel on my BAPE shit
Niggas sad that they feelings on they hate shit
I'm just sad that my feelings on my hurt shit
But fuck the pain I'ma kill it with the perc shit (Hey, ayy)
