Lyrics from Snippets

Had a show in Japan, almost missed my flight
But she robe just a monk, get the feng shui right
If you sleep on that bitch, put your hand in the air, like you listening until that beat  right
Am I that nigga at-, damn right
Bitches gon' be bitches, damn right
Hoes gon' be hoes, damn right
And women gon' be women, damn right
From the mall, now I'm dipping, alright
The sauce, I'm dripping, alright
I done  but I lost to niggas, alright
I used to ball with these niggas until they turned Austin Rivers, alright
They bitches be giving me brain, , alright
Shooting a face ass nigga in his brain, , alright
I pour codeine in my veins, it ain't no paired with it, alright
I feel like a referee, bitch, I'm a fisher
I'm a thugger like Jeffrey, stone at these niggas, yeah
I'm gon' do what I want to do
Time will tell when it  (Yeah)
I'm in hell with a bitch or two
The devil pull up on me, I got to speeding
Every day, I put holes in my demons
Every day, I get high like an eagle
I was popping pills when I was a fetus
I try to tell them I gotta pull on a yacht, fast life, shit get real
I wake up in the morning, I rode and relapsed on the plug
Do they make me...
