808 Mafia

It was me, Ty and Freddie G, plottin' on the green
Now I'm rich, I'm rich as a bitch, tourin' overseas
It was me, Meek Mill in SB, plottin' on the dream
Now we livin', visions vivid, I been gettin' to the cream
Uh, she ride me like an SRT, but her friend ride me like a Wraith
I made the bank close, when I take my savings out, they think I'm robbin' the bank
Fuck out my face, fuck nigga, you fake
(Oh, you play with guns?) That shit cliché
Y’all know I keep dracos right next to my safe
Keep it there to keep money and family safe

Uh, look at me, with this music shit, I'm a God
Huh, Für Elise, for this shit, I'm thankin' God
He made me a beast, put my talents in my bank account, on creatine
And put my neck, my wrist, accessories on Mr. Freeze

Uh, your shit antifreeze, huh
Got your bitch givin' me head, that telepathy jaw
I spent forty on Chanel and Louis V, ain't even try to do it
Silly me, you can't relate, but that's your fault
When we fuck she scream, damn, they callin' me "God"
But that isn't me, I'm not God, I need God
You can see that easily
When I mix Percs with the lean
It's when I let the Devil speak
I'm not supposed to let him speak

Uh, look at me, with this music shit, I'm a God
Huh, Für Elise, for this shit, I'm thankin' God
He made me a beast, put my talents in my bank account, on creatine
And put my neck, my wrist, accessories on Mr. Freeze
Uh, look at me, with this music shit, I'm a God
Huh, Für Elise, for this shit, I'm thankin' God
He made me a beast, put my talents in my bank account, on creatine
And put my neck, my wrist, accessories on Mr. Freeze
