I'ma spaz, breathing fire like a dragon
Nigga off a Xan, on the track I'm probably draggin'
I don't get time for these ticks and these maggots
Automatic flows, load my verbs up, let 'em have it
Ballin' like a Maverick
Make 'em disappear, magic
Niggas get in a accident, fuck with me, it's tragic
They don't want no smoke, nah, they don't want no cancer
Prayin' that they find a cure to cancer, we need answers
Shitting on my ex so much that I don't got no manners
Up in school, I used to skip, and wrote that dogie in my planner, uh
I go nuts like Planters, uh, all of this God's plan, uh, man
Hope you understand I shoot like a child from Afghanistan, uh, yеah
Look, switch my flow up, mix the liquor with the percs
Hopе I don't throw up, lean I pour up
Need some mo' until I got red guts, 'til I got purp' guts
Niggas can't fuck with us, huh
Mayweather with the uppercut, uh
Hit him in the stomach like five or six times 'til he had enough, uh
Freestyle I kick it, off of the dome like a frog, I ribbit
Hop on the beat, you know I rip it
Rip it to riddance, rip it to smithereens
They don't wanna fuck with me, I'm with the fuckery
Rushin' hours, I would kick high like Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker be, damn (Perfect)
Bitch I'm confident, this flow to me it's common sense
Uh huh, I'm gonna bomb, no offense on that Osama shit, uh huh
That's your mama shit, put my dick up in your mama shit, uh huh
WWW, ain't on shit dot com and shit, uh huh
Look at my flow though, I'm outta space, bitch, I'm on Pluto
Like the Oz, I'm a wizard but I'm a dog, call me Toto
Pose for the photo, that lil' bitch dance like Gogo, oh
No-no, she get low-low like a limbo
Fuck her then I pass her to my kinfolk, ugh
007 with the ammo, uh
Pull up on the scene like Rambo, uh
Money older than your grandfolks' grandfolks
Nigga you cannot handle, oh, huh

Yo bitch up in my hand like a Game Boy
Then again I turn that power off, this not no game, boy
Huh, Barack Obama always wanted to change, boy
Pennies, dimes, quarters, all tonight, I want the change, boy
My niggas from over East, you know they got that range, boy
I'm sad to say this not no XBOX, not no game, boy
Huh, not no game, boy, this not no game, boy
Ain't no PS, ain't no XBOX, not no game, boy
Go insane boy, this is off the brain, boy
But not no PS, not no XBOX, not no BS
Nigga, I won't stop
