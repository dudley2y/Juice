Oh, oh
I won't leave

I won’t leave (It ain't up to me)
This can't be happening to me
A wise man told me, that it ain’t nothin' for us to believe
Told me it ain't nothin' for us to leave
It ain't nothin' for her to leave
It ain't nothin' for her to leave
A wise man told me (I can’t breathe)

You better leave her while you got the chance
Don’t even stay for another dance
She got a couple other mans
It was all part of her plan
Shе knows I'll leave her somе day
She knows that it’s not Sunday
So I'm not savin' no ho
You a crazy lil'
Raf Simons got me feelin’ my self
Percocet, it got me killin' my self
But I still feel like the man
Yeah, I still feel like the man with the bands
Yeah, I still feel like the man with the plan
I thank God for that, I go hard for that

I won't leave (It ain't up to me)
This can't be happening to me
A wise man told me, that it ain't nothin' for us to believe
Told me it ain't nothin' for us to leave
It ain't nun for her to leave
It ain't nun for her to leave
A wise man told me (I can't breathe)

I gave her my all
You can have it all
Gone and God, they sharing me 'cause I'm famous and all
.40 on my hip I get to aimin' and all
Fame and I'm running roof I'm takin' it all
Maybe it wasn't meant to be
Maybe the drugs will set me free
Maybe I ain't mean nothing to her
But she meant everything to me

Yeah, yeah
I'm used to being alone (Yeah, yeah)
I don't wanna do it anymore (Yeah)
Really hate being alone, more than I hated it before
Gotten used to being alone
I ain't want a loan her anymore

I won't leave (It ain't up to me)
This can't be happening to me
A wise man told me, that it ain't nothin' for us to believe
Told me it ain't nothin' for us to leave
It ain't nothin' for her to leave
It ain't nothin' for her to leave
A wise man told me (I can't breathe)
