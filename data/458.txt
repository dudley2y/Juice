Workin' everyday, it's non-stop
Gotta stop (808 Mafia)
Fuck nigga, stop (Ha)

Workin' everyday, it's non-stop, gotta get it
If a nigga look close, see the Glock in my fitted
If I ever go broke, I'ma rob me a nigga
But I'll never go broke, I'ma die with bank rolls

La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la (Um)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la

Money is the motive, but it's not everything to me
Ten million quota and my prices still rising
Fightin' off depression, I need money for my army
Percs cost, lean cost, weed cost, army
I'ma numb the pain, you can't see it on me (Yeah)
It's in my veins, always been lonely (Yeah)
But to the world, I'm a different story (Yeah)
They payin' me just to tell my story (Yeah)
Been talkin' to god, and I'm battle ready (Yeah)
I wonder what the devil finna try to tell me (Yeah)
I already inhaled, when I was in hell (Yeah)
Flames in my lungs, fire in my belly (Yeah)

Workin' everyday, it's non-stop, gotta get it
If a nigga look close, see the Glock in my fitted
If I ever go broke, I'ma rob me a nigga
But I'll never go broke, I'ma die with bank rolls

La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la (Um)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la

Bury me alive, in these blue faces
When I can't feel my face, it's my favorite
Don't like psychedelics no more, but I'll take a trip
Catchin' vibes off the percs, tell the world catch my drift
Gettin' lit like a candle, Hanukkah
Feel like the president, where's Monica?
Feels like my demons have a grip on my poor soul
They hold me close, it makes me cold
Now there's ice inside my home
I can't survive in there alone
Gotta lot of money in my bank account
Still don't keep me warm from the cold

Workin' everyday, it's non-stop, gotta get it
If a nigga look close, see the Glock in my fitted
If I ever go broke, I'ma rob me a nigga
But I'll never go broke, I'ma die with bank rolls

La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la (Um)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
