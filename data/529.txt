Maybe it wasn't meant to be
Maybe it wasn't meant
Goose with another one

Maybe it wasn't meant to be
Maybe the drugs will set me free
Maybe I ain't mean nothing to her
But she meant everything to me, yeah, yeah

You better leave her while you got the chance
Don't even stay for another dance
She got a couple other mans
It was all part of her plan
She knows I'll lеave her some day
Shе knows that it's not Sunday
So I'm not savin' no ho
I don't feel you, we don't feel you
Love is unfamiliar, love is unfamiliar

Maybe it wasn't meant to be
Maybe the drugs will set me free
Maybe I ain't mean nothing to her
But she meant everything to me, yeah, yeah

Raf Simons got me feelin' my soul
Percocet, it got me killin' myself
But I still feel like the man
Yeah, I still feel like the man with the bands
Yeah, I still feel like the man with the plan
I thank God for that, I go hard for that
For that money, I pulled your card for that
For that cash, play your part for that, part in that
I gave it my all, you could have it all
Gone and God, they sharing me 'cause I'm famous and all
.40 on my hip I get to aimin' and all
Fame and I'm running roof I'm takin' it all

Maybe it wasn't meant to be
Maybe the drugs will set me free
Maybe I ain't mean nothing to her
But she meant everything to me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm used to being alone (Yeah, yeah)
I don't wanna do it anymore (Yeah)
Really hate being alone, more than I hated it before
Gotten used to being alone
I ain't want a loan her anymore
No, I'm not a loner anymore
Time is going by slow and I'm caught up in the moment
Maybe it wasn't meant

Maybe it wasn't meant to be
Maybe the drugs will set me free
Maybe I ain't mean nothing to her
But she meant everything to me, yeah, yeah
