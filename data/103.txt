Gang, gang
We in Chiraq, ya dig? (Skrt, grra)

Yesterday, I tweaked, then I took a Xan'
Today, I said that I won't do that shit again
My brother told me to describe the perfect bitch
I said, "Percocets" (Hahaha)
I said, "Percocets" (For real)

The blue pills, they give me the perfect itch (Oh yeah)
She told me she want her a Birkin bag
Better put the Percs in a Birkin, bitch (Oh yeah)
My ex bitch call me a snake
Wait, I'ma show you what a serpent is (Oh yeah)
Look in the mirror, the vision can't get any clearer (Uh)
Anyways nigga, It's my year (Uh)
Ball 'til I'm bald like Britney Spears (Uh-huh)
Three round burst up in that chopper (Uh) grra, musketeers (Uh-huh)
Codeine in my double cup, I am not drinking beer (Sip, sip, sip)
Uh, I ain't take no pills today, I'm startin' to get the bubble guts (What the fuck?)
Twin barrels on that shotty, yeah, and it's a horny gun (Grra)
I'm gon' cock it back, let it off and watch it double nut (Grra)
I still got my 40 tucked, that's another horny one (Oh yeah)
Got so many horny guns, you thought we were shooting a porn or somethin' (Smash)
Uh, shoot like the Mavericks (Ah)
Couple semis and a few automatics (Uh-huh)
Run up on me, you get cut up in traffic (Uh-huh)
All my niggas stretch him out like elastic (Uh-huh), yeah, yeah
You don't want static, but me? I'm havin' it
I'll leave your body packaged like the bricks in my cabinet (Yeah)

I ain't have no Percs, I'm mad (Bitch)
May wanna shoot your dad (Bitch)
I feel like a savage, huh, still a sad kid
I ain't have no Percs, I'm mad (Bitch)
May wanna shoot your dad (Bitch)
I feel like a savage, huh, still a sad kid
Ooh, uh, demons in my head, leave me alone
Uh, I think I'll be better off alone
In my mind, I roam

Feelin' delirious (Wait)
Ran out of Percocets, bitch, is you serious? (Wait, wait)
Them drugs control me like a eye in the middle of a pyramid
I need some more, period
I mean, point blank, muhfuckin' period
Don't try to understand, you will never understand
Broke up with the drugs but I need a second chance
I'll do whatever it takes, I'll even take on a Dr. Phil
That's how you know it's real
Love for real, love for real, love for real (I'm in love for real)
I gave her a chance, the devil wanna dance
That wasn't a part of the plan
I only came down here to buy some Xans
