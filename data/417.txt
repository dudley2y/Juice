Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head

I feel your presence on my chest
Lately I ain't been the best
Maybe it's because you left
I wake up, you're layin' next to me
Man, oh, man, that's when I woke up again
It was a dream in a dream, reality ain’t my friend, mhm
Man, oh, man, time to get fucked up again
I'm getting higher than high, so reality won't set in, yeah

Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head

I woke up to see your face, but I forgot that you're not there
It's kinda crazy, ain't it complicated?
Love, it got me scared
The nights are slumberless
Some toss and turn and thinkin' about my life
And where I went wrong, and took that left turn
It feels like I can never do right

Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
