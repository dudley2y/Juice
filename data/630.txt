Yeah, we're laying in bed
You see the— I lock eyes, our eyes lock

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck, uh
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

I'm off the Percs, you don't condone it
You say it makes me act atrocious
But I can't stand life when I'm sober
Take my heart, I'll hand it over
Six months in, it gets colder
I don't want us to be over
Let's make love 'til we die
And let's fuck until we slump over

Be my first, I know that you hate to see me bleed
I don't deserve your love, I tend to fuck up everything
It feels like I'm not enough, no, no, no
This a conversation, not a love song
Whoa, we met in a Twilight Zone
I fall apart but she keep me whole
We met on the West Coast
But I still see Miami in your soul

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck, uh
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh


Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck, uh
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh
