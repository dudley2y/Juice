You say that I don't explain myself enough
So here's an explanation why I am the way I am
I'm drowning in my thoughts, I mixed it with some wealth and a little bit of love
A codependent 19 year old
A codependent 19 year old
My heart for your heart, your heart for my soul
Ain't gon' be easy letting go, no
A codependent 19 year old
Um, please don't run from me, you're so lovely
We both got demons, they're our ugly
We should defeat them, not that easy
I'm terrified, run from my life

See it's not that easy, I'm gonna keep you just like a secret
I got some problems to work out, I need to
But it's not that easy
See it's not that easy, I'm gonna keep you just like a secret
I got some problems to work out, I need to
But it's not that easy

Your kiss and your touch has me in an abyss
My mind is in your hands
Girl, you're so powerful you could even raise the dead
I'm living proof of it, of it

See it's not that easy, I'm gonna keep you just like a secret
I got some problems to work out, I need to
But it's not that easy
See it's not that easy, I'm gonna keep you just like a secret
I got some problems to work out, I need to
But it's not that easy

Oh, oh oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh
Oh, oh oh, oh
Woah, oh oh

See it's not that easy, I'm gonna keep you just like a secret
I got some problems to work out, I need to
But it's not that easy
See it's not that easy, I'm gonna keep you just like a secret
I got some problems to work out, I need to
But it's not that easy
