Lyrics from Snippet

I been tryna feel the vibe, it's alright
Girl you're my type
Put your left hand in my right
I'm your best friend, you're my wife
Ain't no flexin', tryna be a better man
I'm stressin' to do anything to impress
I popped a pill and then wrote a phrase on your chest (Phrase on your chest)

Tattooed in ink, everytime that I see, it reminds me
It reminds me of your
Tattoos in ink, everytime that I see, it reminds me
It reminds me of your love, love, love, love, love, love, love
It reminds me of your love, love, love, love, love, love, love

You gave me your heart to convince me
Now I'm drowning in your love like 10 feet
To the planets align when you kiss me
Turn your freakily side and lick me up
When I'm down you are my pick me up
You know this codeine gon' tear me up
I'm pouring the whole thing, my mind is eroding
You pissed and I know it
You tell me that I gotta make better choices

Oh (Better choices, better choice)
I'm taking my time, cause this is the time
This is the time, this the time of my life
(Your love got me numb)

It reminds me of your love, love, love, love, love, love, love
It reminds me of your love, love, love, love, love, love, love
