(Daytrip took it to ten)

Thumbin' through racks fuck is a budget?
You know she a freak if she sucking in public
I'm feeling like Kobe I'm getting them buckets
He say he a killer that nigga be bluffing
I'm sippin' on Tech, you sippin' on 'Tussin
Off of the promethazine, I be stumblin' (They call me anything but normal)
Not a pedestrian I feel like Gunna, I'm fly like a pelican
.40 gon' spit like a kid with impediments
I pour a four the tech, yea the medicine
I got my hand on my Tec, I'm not having it (Ain't nobody ducking action)
Told me she got back together with him again, he can't ball he be travelin'
That nigga foul and he triflin', come over here girl

I know that he all up in your ear girl
You don't want me for my money, you a weird girl
AP two tone skeleton shine, chandelier girl
Main bitch coming, get the fuck out my crib girl
Wake up sippin' dirty, got a fuego kit, ain't with the fighting it all
Choppa on me like hockey stick, ain't with the cap at all
Niggas be cappin' it off, niggas, niggas be running they mouth
Up until we in front of his house, tie up his bitch put the gun in his mouth (Ohh)
Hunnid rounds (Ohh)
Hunt him down (Ohh)
Gun down (Gra)
