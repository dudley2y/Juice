I miss ridin' round town with my friends
.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start none
Cooler than the boys in the band
Color in my dreadlocks, choker on me, headlock
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay

Now we're all grown up, we all came a long way from the start
We all went the wrong way, once or twice
We can't help that shit, it's life
I miss my old friends, member we was doin' Xans
Up in school, the teachers said we will be in jail or dead
Now I make way more money then them
Hit up the plug, spend they rent, I bought a pint, red Hi-Tech
I miss my mom, I miss my friends, I miss my house, I miss my pet
"Laila, fetch," Mom, come to L.A., I'll get you a jet
Got off my ass and I got to a check
Feelin' sorry for the niggas who slept
Yeah, on me and my gang, cause we runnin' shit this year
Fuck a phone, I'm gon' hold them hundreds to my ears, ayy

I miss ridin' round town with my friends
.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start nun
Cooler than the boys in the band
Color in my dreadlocks, choker on me, headlock
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay

Okay, okay, tell myself it's okay
Got to get this bankroll, everyday it's payday
Touché, touché on my blunt, it's too laced
I've been goin' down, I've been screamin' fucking mayday
I've got too many hoes, you can't stop me
I've got too many foes out there plotting
Yeah, young Hxliday, she told me I'm her favorite topping
Me and Juice whip out the Chopper, then they get to dropping
Me and Juice just took a perky, now we on the floor
Yeah, we just be shooting shit because we getting bored
Took a xanny for my problems, smoke a blunt just for the pain
'Cause I cannot seem to solve 'em, seems like that with everything
So, miss my old life too but I'm steady grinding
It was perfect timing, speaking of time, it's flying
Wishing I could rewind it, oh my God, diamonds blinding
I remember back to the old days when I was biking, yeah
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on my timing
Remember when I got my first bag I was cryin'
Ooh, and I just reminisce, ooh, life is good, I guess

I miss ridin' round town with my friends (With my friends)
.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start none
Cooler then the boys in the band
Color in my dreadlocks, choker on me, headlock
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay

Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
