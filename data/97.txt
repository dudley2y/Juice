Chef Jay

I cross my tears and dilate my eyes
I live with her in mind
They say, "Livin' life is free," I’ll have to deny
'Cause everyday I pay the price
I wake up feelin' like last night was a wild car ride
Welcome to the fast life
I pop these, watch how the time flies
Outer-space, black skies lookin’ like sci-fi
But that's only half of me
That's only half of me, that's one side
But don't be sad with me
And don't feel bad for me, it's alright

Addictions remind me of the summer
'Mind you, I was younger
Trying to kill my hunger, yeah
Addictions remind me of the summer
’Mind you, I was younger
Trying to kill my hunger

Percocets, nicotine, red promethazine
Good sex, fast cars, I’d crash anything
That is a smoke screen, none of those things make me happy
Sold my soul, now I can buy anything
Sad but I'm not a bitch, don’t try anything
'Cause I'll kill gladly, that's the only thing that make me happy
Turn the frown off when the racks in
Ain’t no fentanyl up in my xans
If I could end all of the withdrawls
I would, but sadly, I can't
Thinkin' back, it probably started with the vyvanse
Now I'm starin' at oxycodin in my hand
Rehab'll only ruin my plans
On the bright side, I'm makin' progression
I was takin' four, now I'm takin' one less
'Til I drop the codieine in the Sunkist
Said, "Fuck it," grabbed the pint and poured the whole shit

Addictions remind me of the summer
'Mind you, I was younger
Trying to kill my hunger, yeah
Addictions remind me of the summer
'Mind you, I was younger
Trying to kill my hunger
