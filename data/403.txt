Uh, drivin' too fast (Oh)
Looking at him like why the fuck you do that? (Oh)
Uzi, what you on, nigga? (Oh, let's go)

Brand new Maybach, I can't wait to ride in this shit (Oh, oh, oh)
Drivin' so fast, I feel like I'll die in this shit (Oh, oh, oh)
Drivin' so fast, I feel like I'll fly in this shit (Oh, oh, oh)
Drivin' so fast, still getting head from your bitch (Oh, oh, oh)
Brand new Maybach, I can't wait to ride in this shit (Oh, oh, oh)

Drivin' so fast, it feel like I'll fly in shit (Oh, oh, oh)
Drivin' so fast, still getting head from your bitch, oh, yeah

Huh, I'm in danger
Cowboy guns, I'm a Texas ranger
Chopper from the future like a Power Ranger
Codeine sippin', ain't no liquor, I be mixin' flavors
Bitch, I'm a rockstar and a killer
The demon is in him but I'm praying God to get rid of it
Uzi told me that the demon is really my friend
Make me different, I shouldn't get rid of it
But I don't know what I should do about the demon
I'm tryna figure out the fuck is the meaning
Louis V on me, I shit on the media
Lean and drive, disobedient
Evil eyes, I feel villainous
Niggas lie, Wikipedia
Your bitch in bed, sing her lullabies
She think that I'm keeping her
Nah, she shouldn't think that shit at all
She think I love her, they told her, "Wrong"
It ain't my fault, leave her heart on the sidewalk
