Purps on the beat
Oh
Raining, raining
Raining, raining
You're not the boss, oh

You're not the boss of me now (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me no-o-ow (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me now (You're not the boss of me)
And you're not so big (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me now (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me no-o-ow (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me now (You're not the boss of me)
And you're not so bi-i-ig (999)

Life is unfair
It's been a long codeine year
It's been a while since I cared
It's been a while since I shared
Living out my dreams, riding foreign thing-things
Drownin' in that lean, I'm a fiend, I'm a fiend
Knife made of drugs, I love to bleed
Fighting my sleep, demons torturing me (Uh, yeah)
Juice wake up, wake up, wake up
Night terrors, day terrors
Frankly, I have had enough
Gettin' scared, I'm runnin' out of air
Feel like I can't breathe
But when she there, she make it easier for me to live that's why she can't leave
Uh, wake up, wake up, wake up, it's a dream
I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, can't move a thing
I can't enjoy this life, it feels like I'ma die any second, any time

You're not the boss of me now (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me no-o-ow (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me now (You're not the boss of me)
And you're not so big (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me now (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me no-o-ow (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me now (You're not the boss of me)
And you're not so bi-i-ig

I live with no limits (Whoa)
High, I'm like a blimp (I am)
I live with no limits (Yeah)
Complicated everything, but simple (Come on)
I know that she loves me (Come on)
She loves me like she loves the blue pills (Oh yeah)
She knows that I love her (Come on), I hope she knows that my love is real (Come on)
I want this forever, fosho', sho'
And I love her for real, not for show, show
Only time will tell on her if her heart's wrong
Only time, but I know she's mine
Okay, listen again
Here goes a list of accomplishments
And a list of regrets
If your lady heard my tape I promise I'm getting her wet
The way I live I had no bosses
W, ain't taking losses, oh

You're not the boss of me now (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me no-o-ow (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me now (You're not the boss of me)
And you're not so big (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me now (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me no-o-ow (You're not the boss of me)
You're not the boss of me now (You're not the boss of me)
And you're not so bi-i-ig
