Heartbreak, heartbreak, just another ho

Bad hoâ€‹s, I'ma let 'em in, too
Ballin' hard, like a Letterman, ooh
You got me intoxicated, all the things that you do
Always had these complications when I'm lovin' on you

You be tearin' me apart, like you do
And I told you from the start, I love you

Put my heart under the rug (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
No one got to know

Everybody knows
Bitch you gotta go
Cause I said, so
Said, so

Laid up in the casket, thought it was your mattress
First we made love, then you made me die
You gave me your heart, and I know that it was plastic, fake
Everything comes back to Lucid Dreams
Next thing you know, you hurt me
I'm just try'na keep it on the lowkey
Pour a cup of Hennessy, my stomach turnin'
Feel it in my chest, straight burning
Feel it in my chest, straight working
Mix it with a perky, now I'm slurring
I'ma fuck a bad bitch, come from Germany
She be try'na judge a nigga, can't tell me

Plug-ug-ug, ug-ug-ug
Ug-ug-ug, oh

I found out that love was a drug (Drug)
Now I need to look for a plug (Plug)
Yeah I met her right in the club (Club)
Like a club love (Club love)
I found out that love was a drug (Drug)
Now I need to look for a plug (Plug)
Put my heart under the rug
No one got to know

Na-na-na-na-na-na, yeah

Ayy, G-Money pour me some Henny
No chaser, just straight, nigga
To the top of the, ha ha
