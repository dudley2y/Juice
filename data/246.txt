I've had it
Next nigga talkin'

I've had it
Next nigga talk gettin' fed to my savage (Gra)
Next bitch talk gettin' slapped with the ratchet (Bitch)
Might kidnap they granny (Damn)
In a really bad mood but it come in handy (Ya dig?)
I get in a sad mood without my Perky candy (Ah)
I feel like I'm missing something Billy with no Mandy (Ah)
I get in a sad mood without my Perky candy (Ah)
I feel like I'm missing something Billy with no Mandy (Ah)

If we can't find him then we on his family
Caught your father lacking in the kitchen sipping brandy
.40 on me heat up leave a nigga branded
Gun sing like Jackson Michael no Randy, yeah
It's still a no from me dawg, feel like American Idol
Got an american rifle that shoot like American Sniper
Come get your ho from me dawg ain't none of my niggas want her
Sure know how to eat though, bitch got hell of a deep throat
Coughing so damn much I think these Backwoods gave me cancer
Choppa got a long nose call it Toucan Sam
Call me "Mr. Fuck A Few Hoâ€‹s" wild young and dangerous
Get shot in the face doing that fool ass shit I hate it
