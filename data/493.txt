Shorty want my boulder, shorty on my scrotum, what she on?

She tried to set me up, her nigga the opps, I say that shit smoke
Then I make him croak (Make him croak)
She hop on me like a frog, thought she was finna croak (Don't croak, don't croak)
Gave her some of this love, take this dick no joke (No joke, no joke)
Told her "Don't take it to the heart," told her to act it like she a boss
And my dick her Cuban cigar, puff, choke, choke, choke
I aim to get that cash like I'm Puff, woah, woah, woah
The cops stay on my ass, I got to lay low (Lay low, lay low)
Count the bankroll, I'll be back bro
Keep it a dank roll, knowin' the gang
