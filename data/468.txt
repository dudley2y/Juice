Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah (D-Diego)
Oh, yeah (Mally Mall)

Smoking on rip, yeah
Hit Rick Owens, spent 5K on the fit
Oh yeah, I went from broke to rich
Still won't spend ten cents on a bitch
I told your girl to suck my dick
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, she did
Just got a .40 with a stick
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I did

Uh, came a long way from the trap house
Bitch, I'm in my bag now
I was broke, ass out
Robbin' niggas, the mask out
I ball out, need a mascot
Twenty-eight bands for her ass shots
In the back of the house with the baking soda out
Tryna keep the streets hot
Play your bitch, boombox
Bad kid, Boondocks
Crack in, tube socks
Packs in, move 'em
You are not a shooter, maybe on computers
Your nigga a loser, I'm Ferris Bueller

Yeah, I'm in my abyss (Yeah)
Smoking on, yeah (Yeah)
While I'm fucking your bitch (Yeah)
Ya' dig?

Smoking on rip, yeah
Hit Rick Owens, spent 5K on the fit
Oh yeah, I went from broke to rich
Still won't spend ten cents on a bitch
I told your girl to suck my dick
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, she did
Just got a .40 with a stick
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I did
Smoking on rip, yeah
Hit Rick Owens, spent 5K on the fit
Oh yeah, I went from broke to rich
Still won't spend ten cents on a bitch
I told your girl to suck my dick
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, she did
Just got a .40 with a stick
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I did
