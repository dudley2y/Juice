Over and over in a DeLorean
I'm turnin' back to a demon, just caught me dealin'
Triple nine spinnin' 'round on my forehead
One minute it's nine, next minute sixes
I blame it on the drugs and the success
I blame it on the witches and the fishnets
I blame it on the devil in my conscience
Rebel, heavy metal, demons playin' my guitar riffs

It's 2:25 in the mornin'
Lookin' in the mirror, percs killin' all my torment (Okay)
4:25 in the mornin', Amsterdam 'shrooms got m–µ up in hell roamin' (Okay)
Lookin' at myself from below
Body sittin' on the bed, spirit underneath the floor
Heart out in space, and it's gettin' kinda cold
Feel like I don't got no space, so I gotta leave home
In a different realm, roamin' in my skull
Woke up with devil horns in my head, losin' all control
I look back in the mirror, to see what's goin' on
It's all become clear, Juice WRLD is gone

Over and over in a DeLorean
I'm turnin' back to a demon, just caught me dealin'
Triple nine spinnin' 'round on my forehead
One minute it's nine, next minute sixes
I blame it on the drugs and the success
I blame it on the witches and the fishnets
I blame it on the devil in my conscience
Rebel, heavy metal, demons playin' my guitar riffs

I'ma do what I'm best at, I guess
Try to change the world off the drugs, it's a process
Oh, I'ma ball 'til I fall, baby, all day
Been through it all, baby, livin' in Hell, that is what you call it
Don't call my phone right now, goin' insane
All alone right now when I'm stuck in my brain
With a room full of people still feels the same
White M's, A 215's make me feel okay
The devil's set up shop, he been pumpin' shit in my veins
I need a another doc, pray that Dr. God is on the way
Satan wrote me a prescription for them blue pills
A few pills have me too lit, can't be saved
