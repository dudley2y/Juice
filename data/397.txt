Ball like Tracy McGrady
Ain't no Xbox, you can't play me
Put it in a headlock

Shoot you in your face, bitch I don't do leg shots, uh
You gon' fall down like the beat drop
Bunch of bad kids like The Boondocks
Used to keep rocks in my two socks
My junior year, bought my first Glock
Back then, I ain't know that I ain't need one
