Chris didn't like Xans
Ohhh
Pour codeine and I sing when I'm mad, mad, mad
Pour codeine on the scene (Yeah)
Jambo
Le-le-lean, le-le-lean
Ohh-agh
Let's go

I pour codeine on the scene, interrupt my dream
Nigga I'ma be mad (Yeah)
Nigga, fuck you mean, I'm gettin' this green, I'm gettin' to the cream and the cash (Yeah)
Always I'ma keep a gun on me, I dare if a nigga try blast (Yeah)
I already think I'm dyin', ain't finna let nobody gimme my last day
Two blunts to the face, can't see straight
You leased your car no rebate
I remember doing Xanax bars in the stars, I was tryna sleep my days away
I remember feeling washed up like that gold clock around the neck of Flavor Flav
Nowadays I wake up and I pray I won't go astray

Bitch, I'm a criminal, turned to a general
Don't do subliminals (Uh, uh)
Bitch, I ain't feeling you, never been into you
Emotionally I'm killing you (Uh)
Bathing Ape tennis shoe, designer plentiful
Make it look simple (Uh, uh)
Bitch, I ain't licking you, bitch, I ain't eating you
Your man just sent you off
Two dicks in my pants, pause
One is the clip and one is my cock
One of 'em will shoot your man in the face
And the other one it start abusing your jaw
Niggas be fake and they incriminate you
Will never know if I'm abusing the law
Circle is small, like a red dot

Hunnid niggas, hunnid red beams, that's polka dot
Shoot twice make a nigga dance, that's poker shot
He as tough as a teddy bear in a halter top
That man, he don't want no smoke at all
Turn him to a pack, smoke it all

I pour codeine on the scene, interrupt my dream
Nigga I'ma be mad (Yeah)
Nigga, fuck you mean, I'm gettin' this green, I'm gettin' to the cream and the cash (Yeah)
Always I'ma keep a gun on me, I dare if a nigga try blast (Yeah)
I already think I'm dyin', ain't finna let nobody gimme my last day
Two blunts to the face, can't see straight
You leased your car no rebate
I remember doing Xanax bars in the stars, I was tryna sleep my days away
I remember feeling washed up like that gold clock around the neck of Flavor Flav
Nowadays I wake up and I pray I won't go astray

Wake up and I pray that I got peace
I don't really got no peace, I'm with niggas from over east
Choppa turn you into beef, cook you, like beef
I'ma keep it brief, she suck me through my briefs (Let's go)
Whole world hatin' on me and my main thing-thing-thing-thing
She tried make me go get a weddin' ring-ring-ring-ring
Yellow diamonds and no doubts that's everything, everything (Jizow)
She said the only reason she will leave if I get back on morphine, morphine (Oh)
Turn her pussy to Squirtle, oh, oh
That slim ass waist, no girdle
You look good in a Versace fur coat
I put the Gucci earrings in your earlobe
Margiela on you cause you don't fuck with shell toes
Looking at the past how I really need to let go
Half them niggas you had weren't special
All them bitches I had was messy, you clean it up like a janitor (Messy)
I eat up like I'm starving (Hungry)
Before I eat her pussy, I gotta bless
I'ma beat it up till I'm out of breath
I'ma fuck her 'til you get up and left
After that pour a four in the tech
Runneth over on her titties

I pour codeine on the scene, interrupt my dream
Nigga I'ma be mad (Yeah)
Nigga, fuck you mean, I'm gettin' this green, I'm gettin' to the cream and the cash (Yeah)
Always I'ma keep a gun on me, I dare if a nigga try blast
I already think I'm dyin', ain't finna let nobody gimme my last day
Two blunts to the face, can't see straight
You leased your car no rebate
I remember doing Xanax bars in the stars, I was tryna sleep my days away
I remember feeling washed up like that gold clock around the neck of Flavor Flav
Nowadays I wake up and I pray I won't go astray
