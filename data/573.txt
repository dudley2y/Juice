.45 relocate him
Oven on me, I bake him
Don't wanna move out the way, I'ma make him
Earthquake party, we can get shit shakin'
These blunts in my hands, smokin' on the Jamaican
Whole lotta money I'm makin'
Remember I had no money, I was achin'
Now I got the world for the takin', takin'
.45 relocate him
Oven on me, I bake him
Don't wanna move out the way, I'ma make him
Earthquake party, we can get shit shakin'
These blunts in my hands, smokin' on the Jamaican
Whole lotta money I'm makin'
Remember I had no money, I was achin'
Now I got the world for the takin', takin'

Pop me a perc, and then get to the dough
I've been country to country, the show after show
Countin' row after row
I sell out every seat, I fill up every row
Spend it on Louis V, it be cleansin' my soul
Niggas hatin' 'cause I got records, so?
Bitches hatin' cause I got a bae, fuck them hoes
Yeah, all of my diamonds froze
They suck, and I'm successful
Don't let life break you and watch where it takes you
Drive with no brakes, until you crash into your break through
So many paths you can take, ooh
So much money to make, too
My momma told me to make, do
Now I make millions like poof

Oven on me, I bake him
Don't wanna move out the way I'ma make him
Earthquake party, we can get shit shakin'
These blunts in my hands, smokin' on the Jamaican
Whole lotta money I'm makin'
Remember I had no money, I was achin'
Now I got the world for the takin', takin'
.45 relocate him
Oven on me, I bake him
Don't wanna move out the way I'ma make him
Earthquake party, we can get shit shakin'
These blunts in my hands, smokin' on the Jamaican
Whole lotta money I'm makin'
Remember I had no money, I was achin'
Now I got the world for the takin', takin'
