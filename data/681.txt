Oh-oh, oh (I been on my own for a long time)
I been on my own for a long time (Acer's music)
Took the right drugs, like

I been on my own for a long time
Took the right drugs at the wrong time
Surfin' on a bitch, I got hang time
Tatted on my wrist, bitch, three nine
I been on it for a long time
Took the right drugs at the wrong time
Surf on that bitch, just like hang time
Tatted on my wrist, bitch, it's three nine, bitch, it's three nine

Hit the party with a dumb bitch, she on dumb shit
Makin' money all day, watch you make assumptions
In the trap house, I was bakin' shit up in the oven
Run up on me, fuck-nigga, then it's bussin', ayy
Walk how I wanna walk, talk how I wanna talk
Ballin' with my niggas, feel like Chris Paul
And I'm off the crystal, huh, ayy
Rollie on my wrist, dawg
And your boyfriend, he ain't shit, dawg
Run up, you get hit, dawg
Keep the .40 with the stick, dawg
That's a .44 Bulldog, I call that a big dawg
Pockets fat, look like Rick Ross
Corner-back with thе sack, don't get picked off

I been on my own for a long time
Took thе right drugs at the wrong time
Surfin' on a bitch, I got hang time
Tatted on my wrist, bitch, three nine
I been on it for a long time
Took the right drugs at the wrong time
Surf on that bitch, just like hang time
Tatted on my wrist, bitch, it's three nine, bitch, it's three nine

I don't wan' talk to nobody
Walked in the party, I'm off the molly
Fuckin' your bitch, I'm not sorry
I play that bitch like a fuckin' Atari
Everyone got .40's, this is a Glock party
She fuck everyone in here, this is a thot party, yeah
Run up on me and you not ready
All of my niggas, they tote heavy
All of my niggas, they get money
I'm so rich, I shit money
All these niggas ain't know none
You gon' do some, you gon' do some
If you got it on you, then shoot some
You don't got it on you, you won't do none
They don't want no smoke
These niggas, they be jokes
I'm rollin' up my dope
I put it in her throat, choke, choke, oh

I been on my own for a long time
Took the right drugs at the wrong time
Surfin' on a bitch, I got hang time
Tatted on my wrist, bitch, three nine
I been on it for a long time
Took the right drugs at the wrong time
Surf on that bitch, just like hang time
Tatted on my wrist, bitch, it's three nine, bitch, it's three nine
I been on my own for a long time
Took the right drugs at the wrong time
Surfin' on a bitch, I got hang time
Tatted on my wrist, bitch, three nine
I been on it for a long time
Took the right drugs at the wrong time
Surf on that bitch, just like hang time
Tatted on my wrist, bitch, it's three nine, bitch, it's three nine
