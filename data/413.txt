Lyrics from Snippet

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh, uh)
Wheezy outta here

I wonder if I'm really enough, really enough
You tell me that you're really in love, really in love
But I always seem to mess this up, piss you off
And even when I'm looking out, I fucked that up
How? I don't get it
I'm tryna give you my soul, you can see the ugly in it
You done killed all my depression, you don't get it
I hope I killed all your depression, I hope I did it (I hope I did it)

Down I fall, Berlin Walls
Put my heart on the line, I risk it all
Girl, you brought me to life, a resurrector
I'm the ugly duck, that's my confession
In love, I fall, curtains closed
But I open up to you, I am exposed
Every day, I'm high off you (Overdose)
If I ain't doin' right by you, let me know

I wonder if I'm really enough, really enough
You tell me that you're really in love, really in love
But I always seem to mess this up, piss you off
And even when I'm looking out, I fucked that up
How? I don't get it
I'm tryna give you my soul, you can see the ugly in it
You done killed all my depression, you don't get it
I hope I killed all your depression, I hope I did it (I hope I did it)

Oh, I don't wanna lose you, you don't wanna lose too
I ain't tryna fall out, fuck am I, a loose tooth?
My life is a job, I'ma call off to love you
Time after time, I put nothing above you
You're always on my mind, you don't trust me but I trust you
Baby, I'm a loose screw, that's what the drugs do
But not in a million years did I ever mean to hurt you

I give you my all, I'll give you my all
I'll love you 'til I fall...
