Damn, damn, damn, damn
I told her I need that sexual healing
I don't want no nothing oh—
Ya dig, triple 9 on my wrist
With the AP tint

I told her I need sexual healing, ya dig?
20 years old, ran up the millions, ya dig?
20 years old, havin' oxycodone, nasal drip
Say she taste it when we kiss
She ain't like the others, she the one that taught me how to sniff

Kinda like your mother, prolly 'cause she older than your kid
Give her that hard, hard, like I dropped a boulder in that bitch
She left her ex-box, he was tryna control her with this shit
I wonder why, 'hy

Like, is that nigga a cop? (Uh-huh)
I pull up on his block, got my hand on my Glock, you run up get popped (Uh-huh)
I done ran up the bands, straight to the top so I can't stop (Uh-huh)
I ball they watch (Uh-huh)
Audemar on the clock (Uh-huh)
Put the dick in the Glock (Uh-huh)
I remember selling rocks (Uh huh)
So, the lights stay on, I hit Neiman Marcus when I shop (Uh-huh)
I fuck her so good that she can't speak, no she can't talk (Uh-huh)
All she says, "Beat the pussy up 'til it's dead" (Uh-huh)
We can box like Mayweather, but the match is in between her legs (Uh-huh)

For my bros, for my bros, for my bros
Uh, shorty where'd you go? I can't do it on my own
Give him 6 out the Glizzy, like Drake with his woes
Codeine stains on my clothes, I'm a dope fiend
Don't let anybody know about me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Perc 30 nose bleeds, lean with it
Choppa on me, make him take off, track team
She tell me I'ma jerk, I tell her I ain't that mean
She told me that she love me, I don't know what that means
I'm too busy off oxy, baby, I'm scratching
