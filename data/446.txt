I remember trap houses, bandos with the key cards

Money on my mind, call the carrier to my phone
It's traveling time, I'm going to Japan
I need to make sure my receptions fine, yeah
But besides that, I'm alright
I'm kinda getting sick and tired of these long flights
But it's all for a good cause, uh-huh
I guess it cost to be the boss, uh-huh, uh
My pocket looks a lot like a morgue
Shit, I know what I signed up for
Uh, my pocket looks a lot like a morgue
So do my drawers, uh
I know what I signed up for
I ain't talk to my mom in a week, I been busy
I feel bad, 'cause it feels like we barely speak
I ain't talk to my aunt in a month, I feel bad
I was too busy recording music, smoking fat blunts
Let it all, let it all sink in at once
'Cause it's always fun and games, until you become the pun
Until you become the one, on the news with the OD
On the news with a nosebleed, from the cocaine you bought last week
Heroin stains in the sheets
When you try to put the pain all to peace
But instead you fell into pieces over a Hollywood dream
Heroin stains in the sheets
Try to turn pain into peace
But you fell into pieces

But at least you can say you used to be in
Trap houses, bandos with the lean cars
Now you in a mansion doing coke off a key card
Bitches be like "He hard," niggas, they be hatin'
Tell 'em stick to they day job, before you get impatient
Trap house and the bandos, you was using the lean cars
Now you got a mansion, doing coke off yo' key card
Bitches be like "You hard," niggas, they be hatin'
Better stick to they day job, you gon' get impatient
Just watch
