She's in my head like a melody, melody
I fell in love, it was heavenly, heavenly
We're in the groove, like the '70s, '70s
Love conversations, irrelevant, irrelevant

I don't wanna waste your time
Baby don't waste mine
Heard you were single for the night
Heard it through the grapevine
I was hoping I can stop time
And make things alright
Makin' out at the stop sign
Tonight's gon' be a long night

Why you lookin' at me like that, yeah?
Do you wanna go back to the crib?
'member we was up in L.A., yeah
I was tryna show you how I live
Hopefully, we don't get in this predicament
A-a-a-again
Hopefully, we don't get in any arguments
A-a-a-again

She's in my head like a melody, melody
I fell in love, it was heavenly, heavenly
We're in the groove, like the '70s, '70s
Love conversations, irrelevant, irrelevant

Where the hell is my promethazine?
What does my sorrow bring?
What will tomorrow bring, 'morrow bring?
Where in the fuck is my baby, she's missing
She's driving me crazy, she's driving me crazy, she's

Why you lookin' at me like that, yeah?
Do you wanna go back to the crib?
'member we was up in L.A., yeah
I was tryna show you how I live
Hopefully, we don't get in this predicament
A-a-a-again
Hopefully, we don't get in any arguments
A-a-a-again

She's in my head like a melody, melody
I fell in love, it was heavenly, heavenly
We're in the groove, like the '70s, '70s
Love conversations, irrelevant, irrelevant
