I had a dream you left me
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left if you leave
I had a dream you left
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left, you're my everything

It's funny when they tell me I'm a sad boy
Bitch, what you think I'm using all the drugs for?
Wreck the Benz Truck while listenin' to “Benz Truck“ (Ha)
I won't be sad no more
Somewhere down the line I'll meet a sad girl
Next thing you know she in my bed
Next thing you know she in my room
Next thing you know she in my head

Let's add a little drama to the scene
This is where I tell you that I love you when you leave
This is where you tell me that I don't mean anything
Then that's when I tell you that you were my everything

I had a dream you left me
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left if you leave
I had a dream you left
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left, you're my everything
