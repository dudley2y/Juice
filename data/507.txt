F&N on me, ooh, yeah, uh

F&N on me, that bitch a slut
Sorry baby I was tryna get a nut
Off a Perky and the X pill I could feel the rush
Nah, I ain't goin' back home I can't feel the love
Yeah, I take a Percocet 30 then I take another ain't fuckin' with tens
Yeah I got a crush on you, but I'm still try'na fuck your friends
I'm in a truck with the black tints, run up get left in the past tense
Keep fire on me like dragons, my wrist avalanchin'
Rollin' up woods like cannabis
Fuck yo' bitch, oh yeah I did
Beat it up, Mike Tyson it
Codeine coma yeah I'm lit
Like Travis Scott in this bitch
I stay movin' with the stick
Don't get shot in this bitch
I would hate to whip a brick
But I won't work a shift

Oh-ho-ho
Ho-ho-ho-ho

She on go, livin' in the moment
I'ma float off the purple potion
She on go, livin' in the moment
I'ma float off the purple potion

She on go
Oh-ho-ho
Ho-ho-ho-ho
She on go


She on go, livin' in the moment
I'ma float off the purple potion
She on go, livin' in the moment
I'ma float off the purple potion

She on go
Oh-ho-ho
Ho-ho-ho-ho
