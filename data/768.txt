Lyrics from Snippet
Love don't grow on trees
Ain't nothing but much as vacancy
You won't make love, you just make believe
Babygirl love don't grow on trees
So keep that love shit away from me
Love don't grow on trees
I don't got no heart its a vacancy, ay
You could die in the flames of ur heart that u buried
I do drugs everyday but the shit doesn't carry me
Swallow them in the face, he's scared of me, cupid in the face
He scared of me, drugs to the face, brain erase
I'm in the cut, razorblade
I'm throwing shade never shave
But sometimes I need to shave for a rainy day
Slow down, down
We don't gotta rush things
It wouldn't be the first time
Slow her down
We don't gotta rush things no more
Prowl my heart
Take my heart I don't need it anymore
You can keep the change
Cupid had an AK-47 my heart is a gun range
I feel like a rap goat  'cause I run this shit like Usain
Love don't grow on trees
Keep that love shit away from me
Ain't nothing but much as vacancy
You won't make love, you just make believe
Babygirl love don't grow on trees
So keep that love shit away from me
Love don't grow on trees
I don't got no heart it's a vacancy, ay
