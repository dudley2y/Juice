Tick-tock-tock-tock
(Purps on the beat)
Non-stop, ain't that right?
Yeah, one, two, three, four
It's a cold day in hell
Earth is hot

Met her in the summer (In the summer)
Knew it was the fall of me (It was the fall of me)
What made it such a bummer (Such a bummer)
Is I gave the bitch all of me (I gave her all of me)
I met her in the summer (In the summer)
Led to the fall of me (Led to the fall of me)
What was such a bummer (Such a bummer)
Is I gave the bitch all of me

Uh, I gave her all of me, physically, spiritually, oh
Fake spiritual ho
Uh, I gave her all of me, mentally leavin' me cold
Suckin' love from my soul
Bitch, if you got bad intentions
This ain't twitter, don't follow me
I met you in Babylon, full of witches with bad intentions
Tried to feed me to your dragon, he was gon' demolish me
Demons runnin' out your lair, a dragon and a demon slayer

Oh, I'll make you fall for me
Oh, how the tables have turned
Bridges getting reburned (Uh)
Sip lean till I fall asleep
That's the only potion I learned
How to mix up and churn

Knew it was the fall of me (It was the fall of me)
What made it such a bummer (Such a bummer)
Is I gave the bitch all of me (I gave her all of me)
I met her in the summer (In the summer)
Led to the fall of me (Led to the fall of me)
What was such a bummer (Such a bummer)
Is I gave the bitch all of me

Remember we raced Lambo's like we was going to Los Santos
Have you ever crashed your car into your girl's car, special
Have you ever put a bullet into your girl's heart, special
Uh, .38 special, uh, .223 special
Breaking the threshold
Butterflies like prom night in a limo
I just threw up Cupid's demo
Like cut that wack shit off
Karate kid with it, I'll wax it off
I ain't come here to pop no bottles, dawg
But I'm in the club with a Molotov (Baow)
Juice WRLD signin' out, bitch, I'm loggin' off
Rockin' out with my collar popped and my molly popped
I say Juice WRLD wildin' out, yeah, he goin' off
In the crowd, with no fuckin' shirt, hoe​s reachin' for the crotch
I think not

Met her in the summer (In the summer)
Knew it was the fall of me (It was the fall of me)
What made it such a bummer (Such a bummer)
Is I gave the bitch all of me (I gave her all of me)
I met her in the summer (In the summer)
Led to the fall of me (Led to the fall of me)
What was such a bummer (Such a bummer)
Is I gave the bitch all of me
