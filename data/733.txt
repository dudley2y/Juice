Lyrics from Snippets

Dirty soda with no coaster
She do coke, no Coca-Cola
Dirty soda with no coaster
She do coke, no Coca-Cola
You know? Huh, okay

Dirty soda with no coaster
She do coke, no Coca-Cola

She get wetter than a boat
That lil' ho gon' do the most
In that pussy, I'ma float
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' boss
Keep the tags on my clothes

You gon' need more than a napkin, ho

Chopper like a magic trick, make you disappear

I see some scary niggas, I ain't scared of you

Left my dick in her hand, like a tattoo
Used to do xans in the back of the classroom
Now I'm too rich, I do Perc's on the reg'
Shotgun will tear 'em in half like a decimal
.40 with a dick, show you what the erection do
Shoot up your section, cardiac arresting you
Taking your red, that's heavy metal
With a stick in the crack, sticking to that schedule
Only wanna fuck on a bitch if she yellow
Used to play the chords like a motherfucking cello, yeah

Dirty soda with no coaster
She do coke, no Coca-Cola
Where she from? She say, "The coast"
She get wetter than a boat
That lil' ho gon' do the most
In that pussy, I'ma float
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' boss
Keep the tags on my clothes
